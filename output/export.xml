		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.mccamon.org/images/actionshot.jpg' alt='' align='right'/>A good friend of mine recently encouraged me to give the HipsterPDA a try using the GTD system of organization. I had a few problems to overcome. First was the fact that I like to keep most of my stuff on the computer as opposed to 100% paper. Yet at the same time I don't have my computer with me all the time.

What I needed was a way to sync my HipsterPDA with my Mac. So I've been known to goof around with AppleScript (I'm a marketing guy) and I thought it might be a fun project.

So... I enter all my items into iCal. I like to organize my Next Actions by client so it was natural to just assign the Task (iCal's term) into the appropriate client's calendar. Then I created new calendars for @Someday, @Projects, @Waiting for, etc. No appointments here, just items.

Then I went to print. Crap. I can't print just the Task list - I have to take the Calendar too. Enter AppleScript. With a little copy and pasting from code I found around the web I came up with a script to print only the Tasks of a selected Calendar. I also modified that script to print me all my Next Actions from all my Calendars.

And another cool benefit? Since I use iSync too, all my Tasks are also on my Bluetooth enabled phone. No more forgetting the milk on the way home. Hallelujah!

Download scripts from <strong><a href='http://www.mccamon.org/downloads/hipsterpda.zip'><b>here</b></a></strong>. They might look they don't do anything but they do copy Tasks to the Clipboard. Once it runs, just go to your favorite word processor and paste. Disclaimer: I'm an idiot, they don't work and I can't help you much to figure out why they don't work for you.

If you are having problems with the scripts, <strong><a href='http://www.mccamon.org/downloads/plaintext.html'><b>here is a link</b></a></strong> that displays the scripts as raw text. Need to copy into two different files (both scripts listed in the text file).]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Ten Finger Rule</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src='http://www.mccamon.org/home/wp-content/images/hands.jpg' alt='' align='right'/>Working in the standards market reporters and analysts often ask you to get your crystal ball out and predict when your technology will be a mainstream phenomenon.  While I often take a shot - usually a conservative estimate as it's always best to under-promise and over-deliver - I like to use this question to share an observation I made some years ago.  It's Mike's "Ten Finger Rule."

Generally speaking it takes ten years for a new technology before one can determine if it will become mainstream.  That is of course if it ever does.  Or written differently,  the "market acceptability of a new technology is a decade."  I have seen this time and time again.

One of my favorite examples that is fresh in most peoples' minds is digital photography.  Some of the first consumer digital cameras arrived in the market in 1994.  Over the last few years we have finally seen digital printing stations at mainstream retailers and it seems ten years later we can confidently assert digital photography is now a mainstream product.

Mobile phones are another great example.  I remember in the early nineties you got a personal visit by a sales representative to get you on the list to buy your new "car phone" - for in-fact it was installed into your car.  At that time it was a product primarily for doctors, lawyers and sales professionals that needed a phone while away from their desk.  Messaging was confined to pagers.  Ten years later the amazing ubiquitous mobile phone defines a generation.

Graphical user interfaces on computers (Windows version 4 shipped as Windows95, just over ten years after the pioneering Macintosh in 1984), consumer GPS products, laser printers, color inkjet printers and even mobile music players.  I loved my Rio in 1999 and now six years later products like the iPod are making mobile music a reality.

During the first five years the market must work to "Get the product right" - making it consumable by the mass market.  In the second five years you begin to see cottage industries appear (iTunes music store good example), legitimate consumer volumes (in the tens of millions of devices) and pervasive consumer awareness - "Righting the market for the get."

As a marketeer I'm uncertain if there are legitimate ways to speed up this process.  But one thing I can say when it comes to the standard's market: I'm afraid writing the specification is the easy part.  Regrettably it only starts the clock ticking.  Let's check back in ten years and I'll let you know.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>My Big Fat Full Shopping Cart</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/2006/03/my-big-fat-full-shopping-cart/</link>
		<pubDate>Sun, 19 Mar 2006 14:23:48 +0000</pubDate>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img align="right" alt="cart.jpg" id="image64" src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/cart.jpg" />Ever go to the grocery store without a shopping list?  I was broken of the habit long ago but I remember the symptoms of this way of living: you fill up your shopping cart, spend more than you planned only to discover two days later you didn't really buy anything to eat.  I think too often companies have this same problem.

If you wanted to break this down, the week's menu would be your top-line strategy and the shopping list are the tactics to implement the plan while the shopping cart is the collection of all your resources.  When you have resources with no strategy you can wander the isles looking for things to fill the shopping cart and often do.  With a shopping list you've already thought about where you're going and as early as when you walk in the grocery store you can choose a basket if the list is short enough.

So how does one effectively avoid the "my big fat full shopping cart" syndrome?  I have a few ideas:

<strong>Have a plan.</strong> It should go without saying that if you don't have a plan you'll likely end up someplace else.  Having a plan is the first step in making a good shopping list.  You can make the plan as deep as you'd like but understand that if it's too visionary folks will have a hard time getting behind it and executing.

<strong>Keep it real.</strong>  Having a plan that's believable is critical.  By believable I suppose you could infer I mean something that's realistic and attainable with some reach.  Being a startup with a plan to dominate a market in 6-months is not believable.  The good news is you can revise as you go along the way so keeping the carrot just out of reach is the best approach.

<strong>Buy what <em>you</em> need.</strong>  Don't listen to your neighbors, your parents, your friends, or anyone else for that matter.  Develop a plan that you believe will achieve the best results for your needs - not those as might be reported in the press or by other pundits.  You know what you need, focus on doing what you think should be done and plan the tactics to make it so.  By focusing on your needs not only will you find greater happiness but if the whole thing falls apart you can rest knowing you did what you thought was right and there'll be no regrets.

<strong>Don't buy what you don't need.</strong>  Of equal importance is to have the discipline to not buy what you don't need.  Don't let yourself get talked into buying something you don't need.  Most all stores are designed to drive impulse purchase behavior.  Just because that sample tastes good doesn't mean you need to add it to your shopping list.  It wasn't part of the plan; so either walk away or consciously decide to change your plan.  Check that, just walk away and remember my final thought below.

<strong>Make a new list often.</strong>  We grocery shop every week which of course means we have a new list every week as well.  Perhaps defining your strategy each week is too often; but I would argue having yourself and other staff re-visit the strategy at a very high level each week might not be a bad idea.  How is your staff meeting's agenda created?  My guess is it's the same old 'round the table hit and miss approach.  If you're company has three key objectives, why not organize you meetings along this format?  With a little creativity I would guess you could come up with hundreds of ways to keep everyone aligned with the top line strategy.  The best news if you do?  When the list needs to change not only will everyone understand why change in necessary they will likely also see it coming.  And it should go without saying small frequent changes along the way are better than infrequent drastic ones.  Slowing adding fruit and vegetables to your list to improve your diet is better than one day standing up and choosing to go 100% vegan when all you've ate is meat and potatoes your whole life.

So here's to full shopping carts of the things you need.  Deciding to buy those Rolos for your daughter at the checkout stand is your call.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Your Opinion Doesn&#039;t Matter</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/2006/04/your-opinion-doesnt-matter/</link>
		<pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2006 05:21:35 +0000</pubDate>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img id="image66" src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/04/dogfood.thumbnail.jpg" alt="dogfood.jpg" align="right" />If you've worked with me for any length of time you have probably heard my "focus group of one" disclaimer. Normally I use this phrase just prior to adding my personal opinion of how I might use this or that new product. My point is that "here's my opinion" but it's just one of many for us to consider in our decision making process.

Not to lament the point but focus groups are simply data points. I would also argue they are really too often bad data at that. Finding a dozen random people with a free weekday evening, putting them in a room with a facilitator to explain a new concept idea and then having them react to the information is in my view the most artificial data collection methodology known to humankind. Most potential buyers never, ever get this upfront information in the purchase decision making process.

Deciding to buy a product (or not) is a pretty complicated process. In a perfect world, a person has to feel some pain, decide to do something about it, research potential options and ultimately make a purchase decision. Of course most buyers also have to work day jobs, clean up the kitchen, take out the trash, put the kids to bed and - some - have to also write blog posts well into the night. These together can not only slow down but likely more often than not stall or forever delay action.

Far, far too often I see product teams make poor decisions because of the falsehood of the focus group of one. If you are not a living, breathing customer in the target market, with the right demographics your opinion of how you might use this or that feature doesn't matter. Why? You're not a customer. And even if you are, you have already drank the Kool-Aid .. you already know too much. How might you avoid the focus group of one dilemma?

<b>Only develop products you would actually use</b>. It seems to me that folks that have to "eat their own dog food" are the best when it comes to finding the right mix of features for a product. Think of yourself as "customer zero"; the first person to buy the product. Make yourself happy first and then go looking for customers.

<b>Decentralize decision making</b>. It seems that in organizations where you have to "run the idea up the flag pole" you risk getting lots of focus group data to cloud the product feature set and plan. Let the front-line product teams make the call. Hold them to the metrics that make sense for the business and let them get the product done.

<b>Travel and see the world</b>. If 25% of your forecast comes from Asia better get on a plane during the market requirement phase of your project. Too often we hide in our office complexes and forget about the real world. Visit the stores you expect to find your product, eat lunch where your target customer will likely dine and drive/walk through neighborhoods where you customers will actually live. My first trip to Tokyo absolutely blew me completely away. My "field teams" could tell me all they wanted but seeing for myself was the only way I would have ever believed them.

<b>Slip dates not features</b>. If something was important for the product to be successful two months ago it probably still is. One obvious caveat would be a new unforeseen competitor or the like but time-to-market is not an unforeseen force. Compromises make great products good, good products average and average products bad. And I've worked on a few bad ones. It seems that too often when we drop features late in the game to make a date we make arbitrary compromises that ultimately frustrate the customer and too often the choices are made by folks not on the core project team.

Lots to think about but of course this blog is just another example of a focus group of one. Good luck.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Going Up Market</title>

I don't know about you but back in the day, I must have thrown away hundreds of those free signup disks for AOL. Call it techno-arrogance but there was no way I was going to use AOL when I could just sign up with a local ISP. And besides AOL was simply lame. Who on Earth would ever sign up for this sort of junk?

While I know I'm not there as often as my mom I have to admit to shopping at Wal*Mart at least two times a week. There's now one about a mile from our house and it's open 24 hours. We buy the normal stuff and I've even bought socks and t-shirts there - but I haven't resorted to buying clothes for myself but have in the past for our children.

And of course what sort of nut would trust mail-order for something that cost more than $1,000? Would people actually buy a computer through the mail having never seen or touched the thing? We've owned three and I've used one on and off at work for the past ten or so years and of course I'm talking about Dell Computer.

What do these three things have in common? In most peoples' eyes the consumers of these products are "down market" - or more politically correct "value customers." I don't have to remind you that all of these cases these are hugely successful markets: AOL and the iconic merger with Big Media TimeWarner; Wal*Mart is the most successful retailer in history; and yes, Dell is arguably the most successful personal computer company.

Having spent most of my career in an industry that has rewritten the book on "more for less", why would I be writing about those down marketer types? Because it's where you'll find the customers. I'm not thinking of these folks as oversimplified cheapskates, I'm talking about delivering a product that's easy to use, easy to buy and therefore easy to sell to the mass market. Not something that only the brilliant, beautiful people that read my blog understand, but real people.

As a colleague at work put it: "Let's go with less for less." People like cheap prices and I would argue they love even more things that are simple. Pop in the disk and that complicated internet POP/SMTP mail is as simply as "You've got Mail!". Stop one place and buy just about anything a typical household might normally need for rock bottom prices and while your at it skip the trip to intimidating computer store and shop a catalog.

While we keep building more for less we're missing out on the mainstream who simply want less for less. Some might look at this as going down market but I see it as up. Up market in the sense of the numbers of customers and longer term growth for companies.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Moore&#039;s Law, the Homebrew Computer Club and Sustainable Living</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img id="image74" align='right' src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/10/pepsi.thumbnail.JPG" alt="pepsi.JPG" />For the past 30 or so years innovation has been defined by the march of computing into our daily lives.  The first personal computers were strutting their stuff at places like the short lived yet immortalized Homebrew Computer Club back around the birth of the computing industry.  Countless fortunes were yet to be made by inventors and entrepreneurs who forever changed nearly everything we use to communicate with others in our daily life.  In fact, if presented with today's impressive gadgets back in 1976, I would think we would be hard pressed for any futurist to have predicted how far we've come since then.

Along the way the industry discovered Moore's Law - that the computing power of a microprocessor will double every 18 months.  And in that same timeframe we would almost see the same trend with ever decreasing prices.  Sitting in my home office typing on my battery powered personal computer I connect to a worldwide computer network via a wireless radio and with my network browsing software search real-time DRAM prices in Amazon's database while simultaneously listening to Virgin Radio out of the UK to note that 1GB is now less than $120.  Sorry for using dated language but the number of innovations that make my simple, 20 second query are almost far, far too numerous to appreciate.

Where am I going with this?  For the past year or so I have taken a greater than casual interest in the green movement.  I think there is a lot wrong with how their efforts are being sold, hijacked and used for other agendas but at the core I believe there are some good, passionate, idealistic people trying to make a difference.  To my suspicion, much like the folks you would have met in 1975 at the Homebrew Computer Club.

Today's renewable energy effort is like that of the computer industry of 1975.  Populated by most standards with crazy brilliant lunatics passionately trying to get the rest of us to notice the impending revolution before us; hobbyists with kits that required specialized knowledge and know-how simply to add numbers let alone search the web at light speed.  Today, many renewable energy products feel like kits: they are invasive, expensive, difficult to use, and underperform alternative powered sources.

We need to find the Moore's Laws of sustainable living.  How could you and I consume only the energy we could produce on our own?  Today's renewable energy options, while fascinating aren't even close.  When you give it some thought nearly every aspect of your life would be changed.  How, what and when you eat, how you move around the planet and how you work.  What if you only had the energy you created for yourself?  What if you had your own "personal power plant" as opposed to time sharing with the rest of users?

Finding a sustainable lifestyle sets a premium on both conservation and generation.  Sustainable lifestyles aren't pro-nuke, anti-ethanol, wind, solar, geothermal or whatever.  Just as the technology industry today is nearly limitless in it's diversity one fact remains clear that markets are atheists - they reward innovation and improvements in performance with little preference to which deity is being worshiped.

How do we make renewable energy products so affordable and efficient that billions of us could depend on them every day of our lives?  If we could even get moderately close to what we've accomplished building "toys for boys" we'll be a very long way down the road.  I believe discovering, inventing, commercializing and popularizing ways we all can live a sustainable lifestyle to be the imperative of our generation.  It is our Apollo, our Montgomery, Alabama and our Pearl Harbor.  It is all of them - our greatest technological, social and patriotic challenge.  Sustainable lifestyles are about hope, compassion and responsibility not manifest destiny nor doomsday scenarios.

I'll end by updating the infamous challenge Steve Jobs offered to John Sculley when trying to recruit him to Apple as CEO from Pepsi, "What do you want to do with the rest of your life, sell sugar flavored water or change the world?"  I ask us who have selfishly enriched ourselves these past two decades as fellow travelers of the technology industry, "What do you want to do with the rest of your life: design devices that allow spoiled teens to carry around their music, tv shows and movies or change the world?"  I know my answer, how about you?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>I Am Not a Marathoner</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/2007/01/i-am-not-a-marathoner/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img id="image78" src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/marathon.jpg" alt="marathon.jpg" align='right'/>For the past 3-4 years I've become a fairly avid runner.  Not lightning fast but it would seem respectable for my age and level of fitness.  There are few things that clear my head as well as a nice lunch-time four mile run outdoors when the weather is nice.  Try as I may, I'm not so sure I'm up to running a marathon; but I've played with the idea.

One thing's for certain it would seem I am not a Career Marathoner.  Let me explain.  For those of you who know me well you knew it couldn't last forever; this month I've moved on - again.  In what is becoming a far too familiar tale someone I've worked with in the past called wanting some help, it looked like I could make an impact so I switched jobs.  Maybe I should wear a disclaimer on my forehead: bore me, I leave.

Some would criticize me for being a job-hopper.  Some will say I outrun my problems.  And others might even say I stay too long.  My view?  Life is too short to not enjoy what you're doing.  I've been blessed by having a passion and talent for an industry that usually pays well and offers clean and safe working conditions.  I would hope that my view would be no different if my passion were otherwise placed.

Before I get into where I landed let me look back over the past 14 months.  Life was mostly good at the end of 2005 but for lots of reasons I felt the need to grow up and get "a real job."  You know, one of those 8-5 gigs where the pace is predictable, the work can occasionally turn interesting and regrettably the bureaucracy can be suffocating.  I landed at a local big company and I will admit at times it wasn't bad and others it was absolutely miserable.

We've all heard "ready, aim, fire."  My most recent big company experience was more like "Ready, aim, aim, aim, aim.."  The problem was how hard it was to really make decisions.  Decisions that stuck, engaged other departments and pushed life forward.  Despite this along the way I discovered there were lots of good, smart, caring and well-meaning folks at the big company but even with all their effort it seems hard to turn a big ship.  Mind you, I wanted it to work; just that I think my stripes don't run that way.  In the end I found a strange sort of respect for those there who have the stamina to keep up the good fight.  So while I love to run it would seem I am not a marathoner.

So now I find myself at a small software company named iModules.  I'll get to run our marketing efforts and will be a member of the executive team.  The hours will be longer, the pace faster and challenges greater but even after only two weeks I already feel like I've got my life back.

The company builds social networking software, primarily for the education market, that is used for alumni relations and admissions.  The product does much more than that we just need to find creative ways to promote the product and the company to this and other vertical markets.  Interestingly one of the potential markets for our offering is the association market so I might again run into old friends.

I plan to stay pretty busy.  My family is always going in every different direction and I try to keep up. Side consulting is still going well and I have a near-dead renewable energy site still to care for.  I don't plan to be bored anytime soon.  And while I'm not built for it, someday I still might run that marathon.  I'll keep you posted.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Earth Day 2007 Confession</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img id="image86" src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/gore.jpg" alt="gore.jpg"  align='right'/>Despite turing into a green wacko of late, I have a confession to make: I have never seen Mr. Gore’s “Inconvenient Truth.”  In fact, I have no plans to ever see it.  But probably for a reason other than you might think.  I’ve thought about it for some time and my view is you don’t need to see the film to accept things are not good and something must be done.  This movie is the classic issue of the messenger getting in the way of the message.  I have no qualms with Mr. Gore, but I know plenty who do.  How about we try this argument? Whether or not global warming exists is actually irrelevant.

Many of you have likely heard of “Pascal’s Wager.” Blaise Pascal is the famous 17th century French mathematician who developed a way to rationalize one’s belief in God. It goes something like “If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing — but if you don’t believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.”

I think an updated version of Pascal’s Wager in regards to global warming would be: “If we believe that global warming is caused by human behavior and we do something about it yet we turn out to be incorrect, the world is a cleaner place. But if we don’t believe humans are causing global warming and therefore do not modify our behaviors and turn out to be incorrect, we leave the world a dirtier place. Therefore it is irrelevant if global warming is caused by humans.”

So whether or not you believe the hype doesn’t really matter. In fact, in the end a sustainable/renewable lifestyle is essentially a testament to one’s preferred sense of history than to a person’s ability to be persuaded by scientists, former Vice President’s or Hollywood actors. How do you want to leave our Earth? How firmly will your footprint linger on the environment, the ecology and the biosphere?  I know many of us in the United States are only now awaking to these issues; perhaps it is a symptom of too much abundance, too much space and little history.

There is a Native American saying, “we cannot own Mother Earth, we only borrow it from our children.” It seems to come down to how you want to live your life not what you believe about your life. Finding solutions to less footprints is simply the right thing to do because whether or not humans are causing global warming is relevant.

		<title>The Wildness of Nature</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/2007/06/the-wildness-of-nature/</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 11 Jun 2007 05:41:17 +0000</pubDate>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img id="image88" src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/far_ice2.jpg" align='right' />Too often in our well-designed suburbs we forget the power and wildness of nature.  Often bulldozed to the side to make way for a new strip mall or pulled from your yard as a nasty weed, too often we forget the power and wildness of nature.  Last week we visited a place where humans keep their safe distance out of respect for the power and wildness of nature.. last week we visited Alaska.

Ignore the cheesy cruise ship and all it's trappings, least of which was the endless induction of hand sanitizer as a mindless way to control germs.  See the ship as the necessary evil to force you to slow your pace down to gaze in wonder of the wildness of Alaska.

We visited countless glaciers.  Notable to mention some were receding, as is often reported, but others are advancing as well.  In Glacier Bay we stop to view one that is over twenty stories tall and melting away in front of our eyes.  Huge pieces break off as we watch in the cold afternoon.  The ship cannot get more than 1/4 mile from the face of the glacier as a safety precaution.  Two days later we visit a smaller one near Juneau and we row a ten-person canoe just as near and you are struck with both wonder and fear.  The waterfall, that off in the distance looks modestly impressive, is hundreds of feet high when you visit where it enters the lake.  As you look up at the mountains, who also have within the last 200 years been carved by glaciers, you can easily see the different ages of the forests and greenery that is signature for the wildness of nature.  And while I'm no animal nut, my daughter is quick to remind me we saw three whales, nine seals and seven bald eagles.

But what strikes you the most is how beautiful and quiet it is.  Juneau, the largest city we visited on the trip, has 30,000 residents.  The other towns I'd guess somewhere less than half than that - combined.  Here in Alaska it seems man lives in the wilderness.  Although we live quite near the country, here in the Plains we live among subdivided acreage.  Our straight boulevards and tree lined streets bear little resemblance to the windy mountain roads we traveled to our shore excursions each day in port.

I know humans' mark on Alaska, and all places wild, is that of exploitation.  Not always in a bad sense but also not always in a good sense either.  People came and still stay in Alaska for it's natural resources whether that is salmon or silver.. or the tourists.  Thankfully, for the most part it would seem our impact on Alaska has been nominal.  This is a good thing for I know it helped a life-long city boy like me, in a small way, stop, slow down and wonder at the power and wildness of nature.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Technology Allows Us to &quot;Collect and share things.&quot;</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/2007/08/whassup/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img id="image90" src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/typewriter.jpg" alt="typewriter.jpg" align='right'/>Recently I was asked  the question, "how does one encourage conversations?"  Of course implied in this query is that these conversations are online and free of trolls and spam.  In one shape or another I've actually be thinking about this issue for most of my professional career.  While certainly not revolutionary, back then and still today I think people primarily use technology "to collect and share things" that interest them. This axim is true from typewriters to cell phones, from the TRS-80 to the iPod.

Fundamentally people are wondering, what tools will be used to converse and make our views known to others?  One view is that eventually everyone will blog.  Sadly I must admit blogging while far simpler than the print method of sharing knowledge just takes too much time. And as many of us know, blogging well is even more time consuming.

Interestingly sites like Facebook for the tween market gives us insight into the fact that while people like to know what others are doing they aren't so interested in spending mountains of time feeding the conversation.  If you're interested in this topic and don't have a Facebook profile, get one.  Just by merely using the site and setting up your profile you feed a network of friends with information.  As simple as completing the text box, "Mike is...", everyone in my network knows what I'm doing.  Simply by adding "My Favorite Movies" I'm encouraging a discussion or the formation of a small group.

As some of you already know, the future I see is one where everyone produces their own news (RSS) feed. It's a mashup of "where I am", "what I'm doing" and "what I'm reading - emails, RSS, websites". It (mostly) happens behind the scenes in an automated fashion as personal hygene on keeping these things like this up to date is really time consuming.  Ever tried Twitter?  Where such a system becomes even more interesting is when I could subscribe to a few dozen of these feeds and use a relevance-ranking system to find what is most popular. This is NOT technorati or digg, it is a deeply personal relevance system.  What are the top 20 stories for your personal network of your dozen best friends?

I have come to the conclusion we don't need new tools to encourage conversations on the web; we already have far too many choices (email, blog, IM, SMS, blog comments, facebook, myspace, websites, social networks, etc, etc, etc). What we need is a better way to find meaningful things to talk about and then use the tools already at our disposal to broker the conversation on the tool at our disposal for the audience we wish to reach.  The trick here is what is important is highly personal and changes and we change contexts through the day: worker, husband, parent, friend. And by personal interest: tech trends, history, weather, literature, renewable energy, fitness, politics - at least for me.

How do we encourage conversations?  Find things interesting to talk about.

		<title>The Other Guilty Pleasure</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img id="image92" src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/can.jpg" alt="can.jpg" align='right'/>No doubt you've been reading online, and even in the mainstream press, of the impact of bottled water and the merits of city tap water.  Obviously the impact is profound.  From the resources used to make the bottles, to the resources needed to ship it all around the world and all this for a product that is only slightly better than the (nearly) free stuff that flows from the faucet in your own home.  But while examining my beverage lifestyle I've discovered a far darker guilty pleasure.

What weighs more than three fully loaded 747s, is a nice chilly 35F degrees and consumes as much power in one year as nearly one million U.S. households?  That chilled soda pop you just bought from a vending machine.

Based on the information I found from a few quick searches here are the statistics.  There are right around three million soda vending machines in the U.S.  Each holds between 400-500 cans of soda and consumes between 2,500-4,000 kWh of electricity per year.  The math is pretty easy:  three million times thee thousand kWh comes out to nine billion kWh or 9,000 gigawatts.  This of course for the off chance that you're thirsty for one of the 1.2 billion cans of soda being stored at 35F degrees.

Big numbers but let's give ourselves some way to appreciate what's going on here.  If stacked on top of one another, 1.2 billion cans of soda would be over 89,000 miles high - or over a third of the way to the moon.  But the real killer is the power.  The average U.S. household annually uses 9,400kWh of electricity.  This means in our quest for convenience, soda vending machines consume the same electricity as just over 950,000 households.  Wow.  Now of course if you do even a modest amount of research, you will find lots of cost and power savings products designed to lower this impact (primarily sold as cost savings by the way to the owner of the machine).  But even if it were 1/2 that number it's still astounding.

I won't even spend the energy to document the health, "canned" water, recycling and land-fill impacts of the sugar, chemicals and cans we move all this flavored water around in.

So tonight when you're lying in your bed ready to fall asleep, rest comfortably knowing there's plenty of cold soft drinks out there; at the office, outside your local library, at the school down the street, outside the car wash, at the soccer field, and on and on...]]></content:encoded>

		<title>First Steps</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img id="image95" src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/steps.jpg" alt="steps.jpg" align="right"/>I think all of us have something in our lives we'd like to make better or improve.  The question is how do we get started in changing things?  Is it some special formula, organizational system, motivational technique or coaching camp?  No, I think it's far simpler than all that: the answer, which you've heard before, goes "every journey begins with the first step."  You just have to get started.  As an old friend use to say, "the hardest part about going for a jog is just getting out the front door."  I think he's right.

This "first step" seems to have great implications for those of us who are marketeers.  While certainly no guarantee of success, getting someone to consider a product or service first begins with the person figuring out they have a problem, or what I sometimes call "an itch to scratch."  Without an itch there is no reason to begin the effort to find a way to scratch it.  Without an itch we don't see offers, notice advertisements, see related concepts in our lives, ask our friends and colleagues about their experiences or even do the coveted Google search.  Without an itch, we never take the first step.

The "first step" concept I also believe is at work when it comes to sustainability and corporate America.  While these folks have a very, very long way to go; just taking the first step, if nothing else, makes the second and later steps far easier.  

I have to admit I must remind myself of this potential windfall when I visit some of the bigger retailers who have "caught the green bug."  As I walk their apparel isles I see a World Bazaar of which none of the clothing is made in the U.S. and often where the items sharing a rack are from different continents.  And all I can think is how sustainable, from a green perspective, is this sort of business model?  Should everything we consume/buy, including clothes, adhere to the 250-mile rule as well?  

I visit the restroom at one of the most responsibly sustainable retailers I know and notice they don't use low-water (or no water) consuming fixtures.  They hand out plastic bags, have automatic opening doors and still carefully light many of their departments to increase the appeal of their products.  And do we really need 30" of paper to document our itemized list of things we just bought?

While we have a long way to go, you see once you get the itch you take the first step and from there it can get pretty slippery.  People are finding that itch when it comes to stewardship of our environment.  It is real, and needs to be scratched.  I am confident all of this will get fixed; everywhere I shop, work and travel.  It is already happening.  And it all started with the first step.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>my gtd hack: sync to paper</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/images/actionshot.jpg" alt="" align="right" />A good friend of mine recently encouraged me to give the HipsterPDA a try using the GTD system of organization. I had a few problems to overcome. First was the fact that I like to keep most of my stuff on the computer as opposed to 100% paper. Yet at the same time I don't have my computer with me all the time.

What I needed was a way to sync my HipsterPDA with my Mac. So I've been known to goof around with AppleScript (I'm a marketing guy) and I thought it might be a fun project.

So... I enter all my items into iCal. I like to organize my Next Actions by client so it was natural to just assign the Task (iCal's term) into the appropriate client"s calendar. Then I created new calendars for @Someday, @Projects, @Waiting for, etc. No appointments here, just items.\r\n\r\nThen I went to print. Crap. I can't print just the Task list - I have to take the Calendar too. Enter AppleScript. With a little copy and pasting from code I found around the web I came up with a script to print only the Tasks of a selected Calendar. I also modified that script to print me all my Next Actions from all my Calendars.

And another cool benefit? Since I use iSync too, all my Tasks are also on my Bluetooth enabled phone. No more forgetting the milk on the way home. Hallelujah!

Download scripts from <a href="http://www.mccamon.org/plaintext.html"><strong>here</strong></a>. They might look they don"t do anything but they do copy Tasks to the Clipboard. Once it runs, just go to your favorite word processor and paste. Disclaimer: I'm an idiot, they don't work and I can't help you much to figure out why they don't work for you.

If you are having problems with the scripts, here is a link that displays the scripts as raw text. Need to copy into two different files (both scripts listed in the text file).]]></content:encoded>

		<title>an election observation</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/?p=10000157</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/vote.jpg" alt="" align="right" />I have been interested in presidential elections since 1976.  It was a little odd, but yes, I basically watched every minute of both conventions that summer.  Ford and Carter.  Over the years my interest has ebbed and flowed but I always try to keep an eye on things.  The first election I voted in was 1980 having just recently attained voting age and I proudly cast my vote for John Anderson. I guess I was a contrarian even back then.

For me this year's election, for obvious reasons, is more interesting than the past several.  Over my 20 year or so career I've learned a lot about marketing, positioning, messaging and spin.  I know about talking points, media training the importance of a memorable quote.  And this year we have a bounty of back and forth.

But over the past week or so I've started to grow uncomfortable with the spectacle of the sport.  Crowds yell, hoot, holler, laugh and happily applaud razor sharp barbs tossed at opponents.  It seems the more personal, the better these days.  For some reason it's what we want to hear – a quick punch right in the kisser.

More alarming are the conversations I'm having with friends about the election.  I'm curious to hear what people think, why they do, and what they make of each party's ticket.  Even in crowds I would not expect it, resentment and divisions in our country are alive and well.  And it's not that we only disagree with one another it seems we find another's view inconceivable.  I actually think there are people out there who really do hate this candidate or another.  It feels personal and it saddens me.  We also know the media is no better and often they love to fuel the passions.

After reading just about everything I could get my hands on these past two weeks of conventions and all the points and counter-points made by the candidates, parties pundits and reporters I am disappointed no one has made a rather simple observation: no matter who wins, no matter who, a historical barrier will be broken.  In January we will either be inaugurating a person of African decent to the presidency or a woman to the vice presidency.  Gender and race will be a big step.

When I think about the election in this way I don't think any of us can loose since no matter what happens we all win.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>an update about Lina</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/?p=10000198</link>
		<pubDate>Sun, 26 Apr 2009 20:53:47 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/lina_hospital.jpg" alt="lina_hospital" align="right" />Firstly, many thanks for the overwhelming response of prayers, calls, emails, visits, food, gifts and on and on from our friends, family and co-workers.  The whole experience was truly remarkable and all the more comforting to us knowing I was half a world away.

We were discharged from the hospital on Friday.  Today, Lina is behaving as if nothing happened these past seven days.  Her prognosis is good but there are still some procedures ahead of us.

Lina has been diagnosed with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moyamoya_disease">moyamoya disease</a>.  It is a rare condition that affects the arteries in the brain and the condition was clearly visible on her MRI.  Generally it is hereditary but they are doing some additional tests to confirm this diagnosis.

Early last week Lina was sick with a high temperature for several days.  Late one evening Jody noticed Lina was slurring her speech, she couldn't move her right hand or arm and nearly fainted.  Those symptoms passed but later the next day she was complaining her feet "were tingly" so Jody took her into hospital.  From there it was several days of tests and observation.  I didn't arrive until early Thursday afternoon.

The best news is for now, Lina is simply on children's aspirin and reduced activity that might cause head trauma (like gymnastics).  Once we hear from the doctors we are expecting two surgeries that will encourage more vein growth and health in and around her brain.  Both of those procedures are expected to occur over the summer in Houston.  We don't have a date yet nor do we know what the schedule looks like around each procedure but we'll keep folks updated.

As I was telling one of my friends this was one the best possible outcomes for the week.  The only thing better I suppose is they didn't find anything but then you'd always wonder what caused her symptoms.  Again thank you to everyone for helping us through the past week.

UPDATE: 30-Apr.  Lina's surgery is scheduled for 21-May.

UPDATE: 11-May.  Follow Lina's condition at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/linaloveshsm3">http://www.twitter.com/linaloveshsm3</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/clouds.jpg"><img src="http://mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/clouds.jpg" alt="" title="clouds" align="right" /></a>Okay, there's lots to love about the recently announced iPad.  It is pretty close to the "innovative notebook" I wished for back in 2008 when the MacBook Air was announced (<a href="http://mccamon.org/2008/04/product-diversion-an-innovative-notebook/">read the post</a>).  But since I now know His Steve-ness reads my blog here's some more advice: It's the cloud stupid.

People in the tech sector get the "always connected internet" and the iPad is a nice manifestation of this understanding.  However, I think most of the folks in Redmond and Cupertino haven't internalized the concept in deeper ways; in the way internet startups or mobile phone players think about it.

What to rule (more of) the world and make even a ton more money?

Sell the low-end iPad for $99.  How so? Take a cue from the US mobile phone market and require a two-year contract for MobileMe.  This pretty cool cloud-sync tool would be the standard way to get content from your computer to the iPad.  You could sell it to the public as live backups and if the iPad had a camera (only miss in my book) you could tie iChat to the subscription of internet phone and video conferencing

Today MobileMe is $99/yr and I have to imagine the take rate for iPhone users is low.  If you required it at $19.95/month you would be awash in incremental subscriptions and it wouldn't be hard to share some of that cash with a few newspapers to sweeten the deal for consumers.  Here's the deal: you could easily subsidize the hardware price with a subscription plan like this.  And by the way, US consumers totally whiff on the math.  Apple, you come out WAY ahead on this deal.

But wait, there's more.  The best part?  I haven't dug through Apple's financials but I have to believe the iTunes Music Store and the App Store are eye-poppingly profitable.  Selling one more digital copy of a song or app is virtually 100% profit.  So what would a $99 iPad get you here?  Simple.  Thousands and thousands more people buying stuff from your store.  This is the measure internet startups use so often – monitize the eyeballs.

By focusing on the cloud and adding a subscription model to a hardware device you strengthen the solution, broaden the adoption, deepen the grip, and accelerate the success of your closed online store.  Holy cow, Steve, you'll not only get richer but you'll rule our digital world.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>WiFi Mesh Mess</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/2006/05/wi-fi-mesh-mess-2/</link>
		<pubDate>Wed, 03 May 2006 00:54:28 +0000</pubDate>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img id="image70" src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/cpool.jpg" alt="cpool.jpg" align='right' />Some time ago I compared public Wi-Fi hotspots to public restrooms: functional yet unkept dirty locked water access points of last resort.  My view over the last five years hasn't changed much.  I have frequently used both public and fee-based hotspots both in the US and abroad and in many cases they have been life savers but too often they have been a disappointment.  Often they have been unbearably slow but it was my access technology of last resort.

For the past three or so years I also have watched in amazement so many peoples' euphoria over metro-wide Wi-Fi efforts.  Of course most recently both Philadelphia and San Francisco have been in the news with well publicized efforts.  Just earlier this week I also saw that Rhode Island is pushing to be the first state to have universal coverage for all it's residents.  We won't tell anyone they're smaller than Los Angeles.  And of course my favorite announcements are those from smaller towns where inevitably a city council-person will tout how this new Wi-Fi network will increase the city's competitiveness for high-tech jobs.  Give me a break.

The good news out of all this is that yesterday I finally discovered my metaphor to explain why the large majority of public metro Wi-Fi networks will die a slow neglected death.  Look no further this upcoming Memorial Day weekend than your city's public pool.

What's the difference between the public pool and one in your own in the backyard?  Tons.  While I don't have one these days we've been lucky several times to have had one.  When I was a kid growing up in California we had a backyard pool.  It was great .. no it was awesome.  The summer I turned 12 we moved back to Kansas and I got my first experience with a public pool.

You know what?  It was functional yet uncared dirty locked-up water of last resort.  It was so crowded I couldn't hardly swim, the food was expensive and you didn't have any privacy.  Having come from having our own pool it was an absolutely miserable experience.

Why will metro Wi-Fi suffer slow and sporadic adoption struggling to find a profitable business model?  For nearly 100% of the folks likely to use these networks they have already become accustomed to their own (higher speed) private connection to the net.  And current high speed internet in my house is relatively cheap, reliable and secure.  Metro Wi-Fi will be for occasional connections of last resort - not universal access for the masses.

Some even speculate that even if all this is worked out, metro Wi-Fi networks will still fail being unable to reliably work once we see real-life usage patterns and traffic.  Today only a handful of folks use them; low adoption is not surprising for so many reasons.

What am I going to do this Memorial Day weekend?  Try to score an invite to my buddy's house. Blaine has his own pool.

		<title>my gtd hack: sync to paper</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/images/actionshot.jpg" alt="" align="right" />A good friend of mine recently encouraged me to give the HipsterPDA a try using the GTD system of organization. I had a few problems to overcome. First was the fact that I like to keep most of my stuff on the computer as opposed to 100% paper. Yet at the same time I don't have my computer with me all the time.

What I needed was a way to sync my HipsterPDA with my Mac. So I've been known to goof around with AppleScript (I'm a marketing guy) and I thought it might be a fun project.

So... I enter all my items into iCal. I like to organize my Next Actions by client so it was natural to just assign the Task (iCal's term) into the appropriate client"s calendar. Then I created new calendars for @Someday, @Projects, @Waiting for, etc. No appointments here, just items.rnrnThen I went to print. Crap. I can't print just the Task list - I have to take the Calendar too. Enter AppleScript. With a little copy and pasting from code I found around the web I came up with a script to print only the Tasks of a selected Calendar. I also modified that script to print me all my Next Actions from all my Calendars.

And another cool benefit? Since I use iSync too, all my Tasks are also on my Bluetooth enabled phone. No more forgetting the milk on the way home. Hallelujah!

Download scripts from <a href="http://www.mccamon.org/plaintext.html"><strong>here</strong></a>. They might look they don"t do anything but they do copy Tasks to the Clipboard. Once it runs, just go to your favorite word processor and paste. Disclaimer: I'm an idiot, they don't work and I can't help you much to figure out why they don't work for you.

If you are having problems with the scripts, here is a link that displays the scripts as raw text. Need to copy into two different files (both scripts listed in the text file).]]></content:encoded>

		<title>an election observation</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/?p=10000436</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 30 Nov -0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/vote.jpg" alt="" align="right" />I have been interested in presidential elections since 1976.  It was a little odd, but yes, I basically watched every minute of both conventions that summer.  Ford and Carter.  Over the years my interest has ebbed and flowed but I always try to keep an eye on things.  The first election I voted in was 1980 having just recently attained voting age and I proudly cast my vote for John Anderson. I guess I was a contrarian even back then.

For me this year's election, for obvious reasons, is more interesting than the past several.  Over my 20 year or so career I've learned a lot about marketing, positioning, messaging and spin.  I know about talking points, media training the importance of a memorable quote.  And this year we have a bounty of back and forth.

But over the past week or so I've started to grow uncomfortable with the spectacle of the sport.  Crowds yell, hoot, holler, laugh and happily applaud razor sharp barbs tossed at opponents.  It seems the more personal, the better these days.  For some reason it's what we want to hear – a quick punch right in the kisser.

More alarming are the conversations I'm having with friends about the election.  I'm curious to hear what people think, why they do, and what they make of each party's ticket.  Even in crowds I would not expect it, resentment and divisions in our country are alive and well.  And it's not that we only disagree with one another it seems we find another's view inconceivable.  I actually think there are people out there who really do hate this candidate or another.  It feels personal and it saddens me.  We also know the media is no better and often they love to fuel the passions.

After reading just about everything I could get my hands on these past two weeks of conventions and all the points and counter-points made by the candidates, parties pundits and reporters I am disappointed no one has made a rather simple observation: no matter who wins, no matter who, a historical barrier will be broken.  In January we will either be inaugurating a person of African decent to the presidency or a woman to the vice presidency.  Gender and race will be a big step.

When I think about the election in this way I don't think any of us can loose since no matter what happens we all win.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>five marketing myths</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img id="image96" src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/fivemyths.jpg" alt="fivemyths.jpg" align="right"/>The other day I was reading from an accomplished marketeer some tips about how to build product champions.  While an interesting read, it got me thinking that there's a lot of snake oil being sold as conventional wisdom about marketing; product champions being one of the more recent ones. It motivated me to sit down and come up with a quick "Five Myths" list to dispute some popular rantings.  So here they are in no particular order:

<b>1. People care about your product</b>.  Let's get one thing straight: people have lives and they really don't care about your product.  They have to get the kids dressed and off to school, they have work to do, laundry, bills to pay and dishes to wash.  Cars to get fixed, yards to mow, meetings to attend, family to care for and houses to clean.  Every now and then they have some down time and during those times they are resting, relaxing, entertaining or just vegging on the couch.  They have far too many things to do than to see, read, comprehend and act on your pitch.  Get over it.

<b>2. If you send/place it, prospects read it</b>.  Now more than ever, we are bombarded with ads, pitches and offers aside what we read, where we drive, in between our entertainment and of course overflowing our postal and electronic mailboxes.  Just because I get it, doesn't mean I read it.  And if I read it, it doesn't mean I'll act on it.

<b>3. Blogs start conversations</b>.  Many of you already know I am a huge advocate of blogs, lest I wouldn't put my time into maintaining my own.  I am a tremendous advocate for nearly everyone and certainly every organization blogging at one level or another.  A good friend of mine and I have done a number of blogging projects; all of which gained us a fun level of notoriety in our target markets.  But I must admit they were not conversations.  Long ago I turned off comments for this site as the number of spam comments outnumbered live comments 1,000 to one. This as of course a sad development.  With all this said, I will assert that while blogs are <i>not</i> conversations I will adamantly support the notion they do <b><i>start</i></b> conversations.

<b>4. Early adopters fit into a nice scientific profile</b>.  I've written about my views of early adopters before (<a href="http://www.mccamon.org/?p=39">early solvers</a>).  The key take away from that post was that there is no specific profile for an early adopter.  People buy things to solve problems, provide them enjoyment or for nourishment.  Even Everett Rogers groundbreaking book, "The Diffusion of Innovation," hints at the notion that perhaps the reason certain demographics emerge about the adopting class is more systemic than cause and affect: people who are motivated to make changes to better their lives do so instinctively, not so much for the purpose of impacting it.  For instance, "I welcome change so I take the risk to go to college" as opposed to "I go to college and there I become a risk taker."

And lastly <b>5. Customers become product champions</b>.  Of course there are rare exceptions to this observation but in the end very, very , very few products earn the benefit of consumer product champions.  For decades I have watched marketing plans drafted in a way to create product champions  to spread word of mouth and be an advocate for a product.  The "long tail" phenomenon (where the internet lets you sniff out widely dispersed collections of people with like interests), fools us into thinking, no matter what the product, we can create champions for our product in the market.  Yes you can find a couple hundred thousand people to visit a website about a soft drink, but does this indicate true and fast customer loyalty; that would seem a huge leap of faith.

What works?  Tell me why I need something, after I've figured out I have the problem while I'm looking for a solution.  My best example?  Ever notice how the umbrella rack at Target magically appears near the front entrance on a rainy day?  No TV ad, not an early adopter (would have one already), and I could care less beyond some simple features (folding, color) if the price is right I pick one up.  Wow.  Could marketing actually be that easy?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been goofing around with Facebook for a while now.  It is really cool, engaging and often devilishly fun.  But it is a walled garden, a waste of time and doesn't really solve our problem.  The fundamental flaw is that personal relationships do not transcend context, they are birthed, grown and live within it.  We lack the control we need; we lack the next generation of social media tools.

<img id="image98" src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/venn.gif" alt="venn.gif" align="right"/>Sorry for the high school geometry diagram but I'll call this the Relationship Context diagram.  We have many different contexts in our life but suffice to distill it down to three: (1) Professional, (2) Personal or private and (3) Public.  Professional life is pretty obvious but in this example I would also include classmates for the school-age crowd.  Personal is in many ways both a narrow but deep and wide context.  It's who you really are around your very closest friends.  And finally there is Public which is the content you would share with most anyone.

All contexts have codes of conduct.  All have a certain tolerance for what can be exposed without risk of reputation.  All have culturally agreed upon measures of wealth and success and all have differing expectations as to how much we can expose about our own insecurities and doubts.  And lastly, all have a moral framework governing what can be considered humorous, offensive or abusive.

Facebook primarily assumes most of your information should live in the intersection of these three contexts - the middle of the venn diagram.  It would seem to make sense to give us a lot more control over our content and how it is shared across contexts.

There are some fun scenarios to reflect on that illustrate these points.  I once read a funny story about a 21 year old blogger that was having a great time bragging of his college antics on his blog until his mother mentioned reading it.  Oops.  I know employers are checking out prospective candidate's online identities via a Google search or a Facebook presence.    I personally struggle with how much I share on my blog about my personal life and I am surprised when I meet new people how often they will mentioned they've read this blog.  Do we really want to know you've installed the "Where I've Been" application or that your "Moods" application reflects you love of cats?

Facebook gives you too little control of this; but at it's core it can't really do what most of us want it to do anyway because it doesn't deeply consider context.  Help us connect with people with shared interests: whether or not we met on or offline, with powerful, configurable boundaries of context and depth.   Keep us informed of things that are interesting without becoming an annoyance.  Stop focusing on stickiness to drive valuation and give us ways to monetize our own data.

So when they write the history of content on the web maybe the story-line will be what started as a site-generated web, migrated into user-generated and ultimately graduated to owner-generated; where those who generate the content own it, control who sees it and personally gain from sharing it.  Seems like we're on that path.  Maybe there's another startup idea in that?  Gosh I hope my boss isn't reading this...]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Another One of My Bad Ideas</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/2007/11/another-one-of-my-bad-ideas/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img id="image102" src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/goose.jpg" alt="goose.jpg" align='right'/>As most of you likely know I've tried getting a startup going about a dozen times over the past two decades.  I'd like to think many were good ideas but lacked, I'm not quite sure which, either the courage or the capital to make it happen.  My first pitch was back when the first notebook computers we becoming available and I saw a need for an store-and-forward shared calendar and messaging system.  No one really saw a need but I'm sure all of them now use Outlook daily.

It is an gross understatement that say the software market has changed over the past two decades.  You can build simple web-based applications quite quickly, with little capital and resources.  (Notice I didn't say with NO capital).  The fact that the web allows you to deliver it essentially cost-free to a worldwide market makes finding that "killer app" a fool's quest.  You don't need to find that one essential application for everyone, you can find that useful disposable one that appeals to anyone.  And the digital nature of the web allows you to quickly re-cast your messaging and marketing to fit the changing whims of the market.

If I were working on a startup idea right now it would embrace this new reality.  

My current "bad idea" would be to identify five to six promising concepts that allow people to collect and share their stuff online.  We would focus development to limit the feature set to what can be written and tested within a two-month window so that by the end of the first year you have six distinct products in the market.  We would use a low monthly fee or advertiser supported pricing model.  And we would aggressively follow what I'm calling my "three R" strategy to make the business work and grow in value.  What are the three R's?

Ride.  This one is pretty obvious but if your launch one of you unkiller apps and it starts to get traction, get on that horse and ride it hard.  It is my perception that now more than even promotional, online, word-of-mouth marketing makes or breaks a product.  If you can capture the imagination of the market you can unseat the leader - Google versus Yahoo! for instance.

Rebrand.  I am still dumbfounded why tech companies don't do this today; but I suppose the egotistical notion that "brand is king" gets in the way.  I am not talking about product line extensions like Microsoft Word, then Excel and so on,  I'm talking about a distinct and unique brand for every property.  The web makes it so simple for a company to take one software product and rebrand and remarket it to a nearly endless segments of the market.  Let me give you a somewhat boring example.  Suppose you had a simple issue tracking system; one that allowed people to enter, track status and report on a collection of issues.  By reusing the same code-base with only slight modifications one would "wrap" and market this one product as (1) bug tracking system for software development shops, (2) maintenance tracking system for apartment complexes, (3) low end call-center tracking system, (4) small group or family "to-do" list ... basically any segment of users you can imagine that need to track the status of shared action items.  Each rebranding would run in the wild as if the others did not exist.  The website design, branding, messaging, look and feel would be customized to the target market and the goal would be to have at least four brands of each product running in the market at one time.

Retire.  If a product or re-branded site isn't cutting it, have the systems in place to know when you're not achieving your profitability goals and kill it.  Too often when you take the "killer app" approach you have to continue to invest more money into making something that isn't working to work.  Using the unkiller app approach you have at least two dozen different products in wild at one time and you can leave an idea for dead and not risk the entire future of the startup.

Essentially the startup I imagine would have no killer app, no long-term plan and would belittle the value of branding.  It breaks all the rules of how we have defined what a successful software company should be.  But then again, everything about building and selling software has changed; when will startups (and those who fund them) recognize this and change themselves?  If you're a VC and listening between myself and three of my friends we have more than six ideas already.  Sounds like a good plan to me but then again, this just might be another one of my bad ideas.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Is Was So Then</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/2007/12/is-was-so-then/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img id="image104" src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/mikehigh.jpg" alt="mikehigh.jpg" align='right'/>A few weeks ago Facebook removed the mandatory "is" from a person's profile status; and while I, like many, welcomed the change I'm here to say, is was so then.  Over the past two decades, our interconnected digital lives have been a direct assault on the notion of is.  I'm glad today's tech darling has finally got with the program.

So much of the web, and certainly email, is a store and retrieve medium.  I write and send an email but as the sender I don't have any idea when you might read it, what mood you'll been and if the environment you're reading it is predisposed to your understanding it.  And when it comes to website content one has no idea when or where something will get read.  Is had a tense; it was now.  Not an hour ago, not yesterday, it was now.  Using present-tense language on the web implies a sense of immediacy that simply doesn't really exist.  Even on Facebook my status updates are sporadic and driven more by events in my life than the immediacy of it.

Sometime ago I read a doctoral dissertation exploring the cultural impact of mobile telephony.  One of the observations that has stuck with me is the fact that through mobile telephony, our work and home life have even fewer boundaries.  Each of us can be reached by coworkers during off-hours like our personal friends and family can reach us while at work.  The doctoral candidate went so far as to discuss that our current separation of work and home life was largely a twentieth century phenomenon brought on by the rise of the factory worker.  Furthermore, the cultural shift which were were now experiencing could, if we were to allow it, return us to a lifestyle where the lines of personal and work time weren't so quite as discrete.

Short messaging services like text on mobile phones and instant on personal computers further help to blur these lines.  If you are sitting at your desk at work and are instant messaging with a friend are you still working?  Likewise if you're talking to a work colleague on your mobile on the way home from work are you still working?  I think most businesses have welcomed the intrusion of technology into our personal lives as a way to keep us accessible; but are completely unprepared to deal with the reality of a two-way street.

So farewell to is.  Technology had given us the allusion of is; it was not so.  I'm looking forward to the loves, hates, needs, wants, has, should's and will's.  Is was so then.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What I Learned Last Year</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/2008/01/what-i-learned-in-2007/</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 10 Jan 2008 05:13:10 +0000</pubDate>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img id="image106" src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/baby.gif" alt="baby.gif" align="right" /><strong>People don't change</strong>.  Contrary to what we would like to think, it takes quite a bit to get people to really change.  So much so, I would argue it is very, very rare that people change over the long run.  I can look back over my own life and see some very constant personality traits that despite my best efforts I cannot or choose to not change.  It is my nature, it is how I am wired, it is how I am.  I think we are all like this so we need to get over it.

<strong>Without a plan, every idea is a good idea</strong>.  Boy have I been hit with this one a lot this past year.  More often than not I've been good about annual planning.  This might be for work, my personal life or moonlighting projects.  There is something about writing a plan that focuses your attention on the "big boulders" and not on the "little pebbles" that I find refreshing.  It is so easy in the rush of every day to knock off the little items feeling like you're getting something done so you just never get around to the really important ones.  A plan, with dates, helps control this temptation, and more importantly helps you evaluate new demands on your time as a conscience decision to not complete other important tasks.

<strong>Education doesn't work</strong>.  Too often folks think that if people just had all the information about a topic, they would get it.  People just don't have enough time and in reality we all prefer to figure it out on our own instead of being told how to think; we have to discover it ourselves.  This is one of the best uses of branding.  Spend your energy on both building affinity for a brand and its attributes and people will find your product.  I think this will be very important today in the "green" market.  There is so much confusion and false promises that a reliable brand vendors could use would be a major step in the right direction.  And yes, it will also help us tell the story to people who didn't vote for Gore in the last election.

<strong>Things happen when they are suppose to happen</strong>.  I've been reading too much eastern thought lately but I find a lot of wisdom in allowing the universe to catch up with our whimsical desires.  I'm not saying we can all be passive couch potatoes and things will fall in our laps, I'm just saying with some things trying to hurrying them up just leads to personal emotional misery.  A while back I was struggling to get a screw out of difficult to reach place on something at the house.  I was getting increasingly frustrated when I just told myself, "the screw isn't ready to come out yet."  I sat the task aside, took a deep breath, waited about ten seconds and easily removed the screw with my next twist.

<strong>Fear is more motivating than hope</strong>.  At a recent meeting we discussed the question, "What will the 21st Century be remembered as?"  Now of course we are less than 10% done but an interesting question to ponder.  I think it will be remembered as the Century of Fear.  Governments, politicians, news editors, civic leaders, and even some corporate executives have learned we are naturally more motivated by fear than hope.  Don't believe we're all scared?  Do your kids walk to schooI?  The traffic jam every morning and afternoon around our schools are absurd.  But of course, something might happen on the way to school.  Call me an old fart, but it wasn't like that when we were kids.

		<title>Network-Based Businesses</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img id="image108" src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/network.jpg" alt="network.jpg" align="right"/>Recently I was asked what's the difference between a network-based effort like my experience leading the Bluetooth SIG compared to a normal type of company.  Here were some of the thoughts I shared about their differences and what is the best way to approach making the former successful.  I'll start with the list and give more detail below:

<ul><li>Find 2-3 iconic companies and personally sell each one to get involved</li>
 <li>Enable discussions by developing/publishing draft guidelines</li>
 <li>PR, PR, and more PR.  Create momentum that the train will soon leave the station</li>
  <li>Build compromise into your culture</li>
<li>Give folks a way to show they are still a work in progress</li>
 <li>Branding solves the education problem</li></ul>

<b>Iconic companies</b>.  Needless to say, having big players endorse an effort instantly establishes credibility in the market.  While the pre-incorporation period of the SIG pre-dates me, I know that early on the Bluetooth effort was a company-to-company affair.  There was a conscience effort to reach out to the iconic companies in the relevant industries and encourage them to get on board with the effort.  In some ways Bluetooth had an advantage because many of the engineers initially involved in the effort were very experienced in the IEEE standards process.  So proposing a company-to-company standards idea was familiar to them.  Unfortunately, most folks outside of the standards effort see everyone the market as competitors.  It might not work all the time, but get the big folks on board and the smaller ones will follow and cross your fingers contributors will see past their hyper-competitive natures.

<b>Enable Discussion</b>.  In a network-based effort there has to be something to talk about to get engagement and the easiest way to do this is to publish draft specifications and encourage comments.  Live with as much transparency as you can tolerate.  Open up email lists and invite and facilitate feedback.  Arrange for weekly conference calls and get strong folks to lead groups with a set of deliverables and a timeline.  Set up quarterly face-to-face meetings and schedule when your group will publish final standards.  Deadlines create a sense of urgency.

<b>PR, PR and PR</b>.  Selling a cause (yes Bluetooth was a "cause" for me), is different than selling a widget.  I found it to be much more gratifying since you were trying to  get people to believe as opposed to buying.  When you talk to editors and analysts about a cause you have more freedom to give an honest portrayal of the situation of the market.  You have more credibility since you're not selling a product; take advantage of this fact.  Educate the market about the problem you're trying to solve, what the challenges are and use examples of how companies are making solutions a reality.  You have the freedom to cherry-pick; do that too.  Defend your cause from poor corporate efforts to do it right.  Do your job well and it will be easy for companies to tell their story later about how they fit into the solution.

<b>Compromise Culture</b>.  Jokingly I like to observe that the definition of a good compromise is when no one is completely happy.  I think compromise is a necessary component of a successful network-based effort.  No set of players can hold all the cards.  There are many forms of governance that make this possible.  Resist the temptation to invest a lot of power and benefits in a small number of players.  If you do, you ultimately limit your reach and success.  I'm not saying you can't overcome this challenge if you start heading down the wrong path but once you do you might not ever get back.  Case in point: the lack of success of Bluetooth in the stereophonic audio market.

<b>Hey, I'm a work in progress!</b>  Make it easy for people to initially get involved and show they are making an effort.  They shouldn't have to take a oath of office to admit they would like help.  Give companies a way to show they've started down the path to success.  Most of the companies that build Bluetooth end-consumer products did not participate in designing the initial radio designs, but they were members.  They joined the group (for free) and bought designs from others which they integrated into their own products.  Make it a five minute effort to sign up and try to keep the lawyering to a minimum.

<b>Branding and education</b>.  Doing branding well is a rare art.  It is the indirect sell, the cat and mouse game used to educate the market about a product, service or cause.  If you do it well, the initial investment is high but the long term future value is invaluable.  If I can get you to associate a brand with an attribute, say "overnight," when you want to ship something quick you will first, on your own, think of FedEx.  The beauty here is the consumer thinks of using FedEx as their own idea; not something you had to sell them on.  I see a lot of push back on the sustainability/renewable story from people who feel insulted by the message or messenger.  We need to remove that - and a brand could do this.  And of course the huge win for network-based efforts is a strong brand makes it easy for a tremendous diversity of players to contribute to the market since the ground work has been laid when it comes to market education.

		<title>Tide or Cheer?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img id="image110" src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/tide.jpg" alt="tide.jpg" align="right"/>In a previous post I outlined my "another bad idea" for a startup.  I had to explain to a few readers that I was being sarcastic as I thought it was actually a very good idea.  Since then I've heard some were intrigued by the idea but weren't totally sold on the concept.  Here's some more detail on how the re-branding should be part of your next startup.

One of my friends thinks the market needs a simple authenticated online directory.  I totally agree and it's a perfect idea that can illustrate how the rebranding of software concept would work.  For those who don't know, basically we're talking about an online address book that you have to have a password to use.  It would be accessible from any browser on the web and would let you look up phone numbers, email addresses and the like.  It might even let you send a quick email to everyone on the list - not as sophisticated as something like a listserv, just some simple group mail stuff.

So who needs such a product?  Well, basically any organization that prints a directory.  The first candidate I can see are churches.  Every church would like to make it easy for members to connect with each other.  There is an entire industry around printed pictorial church directories.  The branding of this site would appeal to the connectedness offered by an online directory.  Pricing would be set for groups sizes that were common in this market.

Now take that core code base and use it for something completely different: family group email addresses.  In this application your group might only have one household of members, maybe even just the parents.  But with some basic email redirect functions you could set up a parents@ or everyone@ email address that when a message gets sent it is copied and sent onto everyone on the list.  I have this at our house and it is great.  We use the parents@ address for schools, doctor offices, church, everything - now my wife and I can get mails at the same time as opposed to asking if each other if we saw this or that.  Of course this is an entirely different sell and totally different pricing model.  Your branding focuses on the hurriedness of everyday life and how this keeps your family organized.

You could do a different version for scouting troops, athletic teams, and even small company affiliate clubs and the like.  Each one has different branding, different pricing and a slightly different feature set.  And for a lot of reasons they don't have to be connected in any way in the market.  When you're not connected in the market your branding can stand alone, and more importantly you don't have to come up with sensible pricing plan that makes sense to all markets; churches pay by the number of members on an annual basis, while families might like a small monthly fee - or free for very limited capabilities.

I cannot better illustrate the importance of disconnected branding than the Disney Company, which of course owns ABC and ESPN.  Essentially they find programming and air it through their "channels" with different pricing models (ABC free, ad sponsored, ESPN subscription paid by cable operators - with ad sponsored too).  Imagine SportsCenter's audience reaction if it were branded "Disney"; no one would watch it.  Okay, I know it was an acquisition but you get the idea.  

Another great example is the household liquid soap market.  At my grocery store I counted three different manufactures but over a dozen different brands of soap.  Basically the only difference was the packaging, the price and the scent.  There is another reason why they do this; to consume shelf space thereby locking out more rivals.  The internet conceptually has unlimited shelf space but here too I would ask, how many bookmarking sites can you name off the top of your head?  If you make it to a dozen you're doing better than the grocery store and soap.

Sadly we are nearing a point where marketing (and branding) will be the single most important thing to get right in the success of a startup.  Why not hedge your bet?  I say, build it once and sell, resell, resell and resell.

		<title>Looking for a Job?  Try Facebook</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/2008/01/looking-for-a-job-try-facebook/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img id="image112" src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/helpw.jpg" alt="helpw.jpg" align="right"/>If you're out there looking for a job and would like to get in with a moderate to large company here's a trick you might want to give a try.  After endless hours plowing the web and job sites, after filling out mountains of forms for each job you've found interesting and countless calls trying to network; why not try this idea?

Pick where you want to work and advertise yourself to that audience on Facebook.  No guarantees - but it might just might get you noticed.

Here's how you do it.  Visit Facebook's advertising site.  Create an ad that links back to your resume or blog.  When you define your audience, enter your dream company into the "Workplace" field.  Estimate how old your hiring manager would likely be to narrow the hit list.  Interested in working for Apple?  There are about 960 people on Facebook who live in California, work at Apple and are over the age of 29.  Set your budget and date range (maybe run for a couple of days to test) and see what happens.

Not sure how effective this approach might be ... you are approaching someone for a job in a very off-hours social context but you never know.  And be forewarned this clever idea might get old fast.  If you pay for clicks, limit your exposure to $5 a day, the weekly expense isn't so bad.  

The timeless Parachute job searching book had a quote that I think is timeless and helped sustain me through one such search: Remember that all those "no's" just get you closer to the one "yes" you need.  And who knows?  It just might work.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Married Minors and the Future of Facebook</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/2008/02/married-minors-and-the-future-of-facebook/</link>
		<pubDate>Tue, 12 Feb 2008 05:55:16 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img id="image117" src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/wedding.jpg" alt="wedding.jpg"  align="right"/>After about 20 minutes of fun it was clear that I could write dozens of posts about the demographics of Facebook.  But it's getting late so for now I'll only focus on a few fun facts.  Thanks to Vince for encouraging me to check out the link - http://www.facebook.com/ads, it made my day.

So all of my readers likely have heard the well documented success of Facebook; and it's darling status as THE tool people need to exploit for their latest marketing endeavor.  What is pretty remarkable is how much data folks are offering up about themselves that Facebook can use to target marketing back to the users.  I suppose it's a lot less than what Google has on it's millions of Gmail users but it seems everyone's forgotten about that privacy issue for now.

But there is dark side of Facebook data: it is certainly not clean data.  Today I was visiting the page I mention above and it was fun to play with the form that dynamically updated how many Facebook users would see my advertisement.  Starting with just over 22 million folks I could slice and dice to my hearts content.
  
For sometime I have been critical of user-supplied data and the reliability of that content, but nothing prepared me for this:  5.4% of U.S. teenagers 13-17 years old are married.  That's right, about 220,000 of the 4.1 millions folks on Facebook in that demographic chose the "married" relationship status.  And 7,200 of them are college graduates to boot.

I also dug into some other interesting aspects of the data.  Based on figures from the US Census bureau, it seems that nearly 40% of all 13-17 year olds in Kansas are on Facebook compared to less than 9% for the same group in California.  In fact, the per capita subscription of Kansas teens is 4x compared to California.  Surprisingly New York had the most teens on Facebook.  What happened to the Golden State's high-tech lead?

When you start looking into the celebrated "high growth" segments of Facebook you can really see the reach is pretty low.  With less than 1.2 million users over the age of 36, Facebook users in this demographic represent less than 0.8% of the U.S. population for this age group.  Considering that same week, syndicated reruns of "Everyone Loves Raymond" was seen by 5.9 million viewers it would seem if you're trying to reach old people you might want to keep looking.

Okay, throw me from the bus!  Yes, you can highly target ads on Facebook.  Yes, they have a TON of eyeballs and yes social networking is hot ... and yes I have a Facebook account I visit everyday.  But all this demographic data is in the end quite worthless.  What Facebook really needs is what I call "intentional data" - information about what a user is planning to do.  Knowing I'm 45, married, living in 66224 isn't very interesting.  Yes, as an advertiser I can infer lots of things about a person with those demographics but it pales to intentional data.  Knowing I read Treehugger.com and am in the market for a new car is quite another and far more valuable to advertisers.  

Someday in the future it won't be about who you say you are, it will be about what you plan to do.

<blockquote><i>UPDATE: Yes I've heard from a few of you that teens play around with relationship status.  I know that my teenagers' peers, when in a serious relationship, set their status to married.  My goal was to highlight the potential weaknesses in believing user-generated content and the limitations of any demographic data when marketing a product.  When it comes to technology there are many who praise and celebrate it's newness.  You would think that with social networking tools we could transcend the 1950's way of seeing people - as nicely sliced demographic faceless trolls.</i></blockquote>

		<title>Product Diversion - An Innovative Notebook</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/duo.jpg" align="right"/>While I'm less of a "toys for boys" kind of guy these days I am staring at five years on my current notebook and have been thinking about the new MacBook Air.  You know, the one they slide out of a manila folder in the ad?  Lots of cool ideas but in a lot of ways I'm actually disappointed.

Let me first tell you, over the past twenty-five years the best computer I've ever used was a Powerbook Duo in 1994.  It was fast, light, small, and highly focused on the mobile experience ... and it had a great docking solution.  I always had all my stuff with me and I had only what I needed where I was.  It didn't have a PC Card slot (standard in it's day), a floppy drive (standard in it's day).  Nor did it have a CD-ROM drive or wired ethernet.  Those features were in the dock.  Interesting.

So when I look at the Air I see the Duo with 14 years of speed improvement with a little wireless neatly tucked inside.  Pretty cool, but in a way a sad statement of how slow we have innovated the conceptual design of a notebook computer.

What would break the mold and demonstrate real innovation in the market?  Basically an oversized iPhone.  So before you chronicle the sad efforts with pen based computing let me explain how this one could be different.

Firstly, the primary UI would be the iPhone Launcher.  Windows is a crappy operating system for a pen interface.  It always felt bolted on and clunky.  The TabletPC too often tried to be everything to everyone - a useful desktop computer, notebook and tablet.  My next mobile computer would be the ultimate digital notebook.  What I am imagining is a flat (thin) device like the iPhone about 8x10 and less than an inch thick.  There is no "cover," only the touch screen like the iPhone. Perhaps Launcher could be modified to have dynamic icons that would be more like Dashboard widgets with mini views of your calendar, your notes and content on the web.

But what about a keyboard?  First, you need to understand that my tablet would really be a portable display in disguise.  The "dock" would be a stand for my tablet on my desk so I could use a standard keyboard when tapping away all day long at the office, connect to power and other interfaces.  But ... when I'm ready to go I just grab the "display" and I'm off.  

Come one, what about a keyboard?  When I'm on the plane or in a meeting, I would be able to invoke a software defined keyboard that takes up 30% of the screen (with transparency so it's floating over your desktop and documents).  In fact there would be several different versions of keyboard, one for landscape, one for portrait and one for two-hand gripping - the iPhone keyboard broken in two on each side of the display.  And having a software defined keyboard would solve a tremendous problem in international markets - since they keyboard could easily be configured to be vastly different from English-centric QWERTY.

But alas, the breakthrough here is the observation that you don't really need a keyboard for most of the stuff you do when you're mobile.  Think about it.  When you're away from your desk you do some typing but often we're just surfing to a web site, peaking at e-mail or when on a plane, watching a movie or listening to music.  Oh, and that bigger display would be sweet for watching videos when I'm away from my desk.  And when I return I drop the display into the dock and in about an hour I'll be ready to head off to my next appointment.

So there you have it.  The first innovative notebook since the Duo.

		<title>Your Most Cherished Dreams</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img id="image122" src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/meditate.jpg" alt="meditate.jpg" align="right"/>A few months ago I got an interesting note in a fortune cookie.  It read, "Hold onto your most cherished dreams."  As usual, this fortune was authored as a generality and therefore would apply to most anyone but for some reason it really stuck with me.  And the questions I started asking myself were, "what <strong>are</strong> my most cherished dreams?"  and "how would I prioritize them?"

I wrote, re-wrote and then re-wrote them again.  Only after a few weeks was I happy with the results.  So while I know I need to get better in directing my daily habits and actions to achieve them at least now I have a list:

<ol>
<li>Be at peace with my healthy body, calm mind and charitable soul</li>
<li>Raise responsible, caring and inspired children</li>
<li>Enjoy loving relationships while living in a warm, nurturing home</li>
<li>Blissfully wonder in experiencing the beauty and mystery of creation</li>
<li>Have prosperous, invigorating work that leaves a positive impact</li>
</ol>

Being at the top of the list, my most cherished dream is to be at peace.  I need to have a healthy body to chase my dreams so I need to exercise, eat well and (occasionally) get plenty of sleep.  I need to keep an uncluttered mind and strive to be calm and emotively disconnected with the outcome of events in my life.  What will be, will be.  I also need to find ways to soulfully respond to events and challenges in my life in a kind and loving way that helps others.

Certainly as a father I want my kids to be happy, but I also want them to grow into respectable adults.  I think to do that they need to be responsible, learn empathy for others and find something they are passionate about.  I am a firm believer that much of this world's sadness comes from people who don't pursue their own dreams and passions.  Like the saying goes, do what you love and you'll never work another day of your life.

It is important to have caring relationships to encourage and care for us on our journey through life.  Healthy ones go both ways as friends carry you a few steps after you've carried them.  For much of my life I've felt home has been too hectic and seclusive.  My habits contribute to the current state of affairs and I know why my life was like that when I was younger.

Finally I want to have impactful work for my days.  I'm trying to use the term "work" generically but yes, I also mean the work for which I draw a salary.  I believe my skills are mixed in a rare and valuable way so I hope I can find fiscal prosperity.  My work should challenge my thinking, my skills, push me and help me grow nearly every day – and not just in the obvious ways but also put me into situations that push me out of my comfort zone and into a better understanding of my life.  All this, while looking to make a positive lasting impact.  I'm not so sure dedicating my life to an I.P.O. moment makes the impact I'd like to leave.  This is not judgmental, simply my view of the type of footprints I want to leave when I'm gone.

So there's my list.  What's yours?  I know it's a rough one and I've got some work to do, but even at 45 it's okay to have dreams, right?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/siliconguy.jpg"><img title="siliconguy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/siliconguy.jpg" alt="" align="right" /></a>Ever since 1991 I have dreamed of running a software company.  You know the drill.  Couple of folks working insane hours in a no-rules, no-stupidity environment to deliver an insanely great product that will be the talk of the industry.  And for me the point of doing it was to just to just do it, not to focus on the big IPO or buyout for untold riches.  No, it was my dream simply because it sounded like a load of fun.

Over the past 17 years I have written up a dozen or so business plans, forecasted businesses over four year horizons, developed pitch decks and tried to excite investors or partners.  There was the electronic calendar to-do list manager in 1991 all the way through the relevant news readers in 2006.  Along the way there was a Bluetooth switch product, a mobloging product, and a precursor to the SurfWatch products today that ensure a safe online experience.  Even over the past two years I've shared and heard some great ideas that I have yet to go to the effort for the eventual disappointment of developing a business plan that no one found of interest.

But this past weekend I decided that's it, I give up.  Uncle.  It is not suppose to be and me fighting it only makes me miserable while facing tremendous life opportunity costs.  I'll never say never, but I'm not going to actively pursue this dream any longer.  I'm going to follow that road that unfolds before me.  This was the epiphany I had over the weekend that has led me to this decision.

In 1997 I temporarily abandoned this idea of running a software company and just followed the river downstream.  What happened?  I got a great job that landed me in California. That one led to an even better job in Geneva that despite a shortened stay led to an even better job working on Bluetooth at Intel.  That one ultimately worked it's way into the most enjoyable job I've ever had, running the Bluetooth SIG.  And then I got the itch to start a software company.  I won't go into the details but I made decisions to help me back onto that path and now I can see how it failed spectacularly.

When I was letting the plan unfold before me I was following my life path.  When I tried to make it go the direction I wanted it didn't work out.  When I wasn't pursuing my dream to run a software company I learned I was a great pragmatic strategist who could develop innovative plans that moved markets.  When I wasn't pursing my dream to run a software company I learned I was an incredible evangelist for new ideas who could easily hold his own with the toughest of analysts, customers or editors.  When I didn't pursue my outdated dream I came into my own and found respect, empathy for others and greatness.  This is why I must abandon my dream of running a software company; it withholds me from my path.

So watch out,  I've given up my dream.  Who knows what might happen next.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Bluetooth v Cluetrain</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/2008/06/bluetooth-v-cluetrain/</link>
		<pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2008 03:48:31 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/winner.jpg" alt="" align="right" />This year is the 10-year anniversary of both Bluetooth technology and the Cluetrain Manifesto; probably the two biggest influences in my professional life over this past decade as well.  It got me wondering, "which one has been more successful?"

Most of you likely already know about Bluetooth and my role with the trade group.  Certainly a very successful wireless technology as measured by radios shipped in products, but perhaps not so much in the way of customer usage.  The dream that was Bluetooth was no less to become the universal low-power wireless interconnect for electronic products.  Arguably, today it is solely a connection method for headsets and mobile phones.  A gigantic market to be sure, but a far cry from it's original aspirations.

Some of my old colleagues in the Bluetooth market will take issue with my assessment saying there are dozens of other use cases for the technology and so while I agree there are lots of use cases, today there are few uses.  Stereo music, until embraced by Apple, is a complete full stop.  The computer industry is a sad hodgepodge of limited usefulness and frustration.  Imaging?  Printers, cameras and the like have yet to materialize in meaningful significant numbers.  So while you can technically use Bluetooth to make these connections both manufacturers and consumers have yet to do so in measureable numbers.

The Cluetrain Manifesto (<a href="http://cluetrain.com">cluetrain.com</a>) is likely less known by most but I can make the argument, unlike Bluetooth, it's pervasiveness  and influence continues to accelerate.  In its 95 theses the manifesto (and book) describe the direction of marketing in the digital age – that new technologies will make marketing a bidirectional interaction not a passive receive phenonemun.  In fact, the first of its 95 theses are: "Markets are conversations."

We can see the explosive adoption of participatory engagement marketing all around us.  It is ridiculously easy for any delighted or disgruntled customer to share their experience with others: though online social networks, discussion forums, blogs, and even on your Facebook Wall.  Feedback is instantaneous, direct and often shared with others.  And the long tail can assure vocal customers will find an audience.

Customers can now talk amongst themselves about which is the best product.  Corporations no-longer own the message about their product.  Before recent technology, corporations controlled when, how and what you knew about new products, problems and policies.   Today a college kid can host a wildly successful blog just speculating what your next plan might be.

Cluetrain encourages us to participate in the conversation.  It's happening anyway; and most would rather be a trusted source of information in the discussion as opposed to a helpless bystander.

Sadly one principle of Cluetrain that has yet to have the adoption I would like to see concerns transparency.  Corporate spin is alive and well.  Some still carefully choose to hide secrets that arguably could make products and the markets they serve more efficient with higher velocity.  Consumers are saying "tell us where you're going and we'll be glad to tell you if that's what we want."  They are also saying, "tell us the truth when things go wrong, tell us when you don't know and just be honest and open with us."  Sounds pretty simple to me.

It's been a wild ride these past ten years. In my book, I'd have to say over the past decade hands down the winner is the Cluetrain.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The Payphone and the iPhone</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/canidates.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10000140" title="2008can" src="http://mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/canidates.jpg" alt=""  align="right"/></a>If Barack Obama could be compared to the iPhone, then it might seem that John McCain is the payphone.  But before I get any further in this post, I should disclaim that I have yet to decide whom I might vote for this November and I am a huge Apple product fan and love the iPhone.  Now for some fun...

Why do people like the iPhone?  Lots of reasons.  I think we can characterize it as something that feels genuinely new in the already tired category of smart phones.  It screams "change!" like no other product in the category.  No keyboard, beautiful and elegant user interface, modern base operating system and what looks to be an unlimited potential.

But ... it also has it's short-comings.  When you dig deeper, with a level-head, you see a product that not until next month will get 3G, a technology that has been shipping in the rest of the world for years.  The camera is nice but lots of phones already have movie capability.  Push mail, a hailed new feature of the next iPhone, has been a pervasive standby of Blackberry for years.  So while the iPhone is very new, when you look closer at some of it's most herald features it's not very new at all.

I will not bore you with all the numbers of the payphone market in the US.  Suffice to say, it's pretty dismal.  What was once a common street corner companion now has become an endangered species by the mobile phone.  Today there are less than one million operational payphones in the US.  A decade ago there were nearly three million.  I cannot remember the last time I used one myself.  They will soon join the train and horse-drawn buggy as popular modes of transportation in the US.

But wait.  There is a resurgence of payphones in the developing world.  And not like you might think – imagine GSM-based payphones.  I saw a similar phenomenon on my trip to Phnom Phem in 2001.  The poor cannot afford their own phone so like the party-lines of the 1940s in the US, small groups of people use one GSM phone as a community phone.  Today in China they are installing mobile phones (without the need for wired infrastructure) that include a card reader and change depository.

So when we superficially evaluate the iPhone and payphones we cannot see the full truth.  On the one hand, anyone can see payphones are literally an aging idea from a technologically distant past.  They are tired and old – much like how many might characterize McCain and his politics.  But when you look harder you can see the concept is still very much alive and is of great value to many around world.  The iPhone has been celebrated as a change agent in a slow moving industry – much like the moniker of the junior Senator from Illinios.  But, as we've seen, when you dig deeper much of it really isn't that new after all and in someways it isn't much better than other products on the market.

Like I said, I have no idea whom I am going to vote for in November.  And analogies aside, I still love the diea of an iPhone.  That is, at least for a test drive.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Has Apple Done it Again?</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/2008/08/has-apple-done-it-again/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/appstore.jpg"><img src="http://mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/appstore.jpg" align="right" /></a>Let me start out admitting I'm a total Apple homer.  I worked at the fruit company a digital lifetime ago but still consider it one of the better jobs over my 20+ year career.  While I still haven't broken down and bought an AppleTV I've certainly pacified my fetish for Apple gear most recently with an iPhone 3G.  Over the past week I've started to ask myself the question, "has Apple done it again?"  Has Apple reinvented the software business the same way it did for music?

We all know the story about digital music and the iPod.  I'm sure there are many angles to take on this one; the piracy story, the compression story, the record-label view, the artist view, the consumer and on and on, but I think it's easy to argue the iPod saved the music industry.  Yes, musicians and their handlers hate to admit it, but I know more people who, after buying an iPod, have bought more music than they had on their own without an iPod for years - or in my case decades.  A buck is easy and often times it's an impulse buy.  How else can I explain buying The Knack's "My Sharona"? (If you didn't graduate high school around 1980 you won't get it).  It also helps the model let's you buy only exactly what you want – not the industry-preferred packaging of albums.

And another funny thing happened.  Today, even a good many of the teens I know are going legal as opposed to downloading ripped music from illegal file sharing sites.  Apple made it easy to be legal, provided value over a free download with things like cover art, and simplified the process with the iTunes store and gift cards.  What's the standard birthday gift for a teen these days?  A gift card to the iTunes store.

I can still hear the music industry complaining – but I ask, "where would they be without the iPod?"

So let's now turn our attention to the computer software industry.  Today, MS-Office withstanding, most folks rarely buy software these days.  More and more free shareware and web-based tools are becoming available online so dropping more than $20 on an unknown feels like a real gamble.  I know the velocity of the packaged software industry of 2008 is radically different from a decade ago.

In some ways you can see parallels between the historical software and music industries: (1) their packaging strategy is customer-hostile, (2) market consolidation was bad for consumers and (3) they both have unnecessarily long (non)value-add chains.  Let me explain.

Both industries have pursued a packaging strategy that is customer-hostile.  To buy the single song we wanted, we had to buy the entire album.  Similarly, in the software business to get the 10% of a program we really need we have to buy 80% we don't want and will never use.  Of course this strategy was pursued to increase margin through perceived value: the hardware delivery cost for one or ten songs was the same so why not bundle a bunch of stuff together and charge more?

More and more, there are only a few big record labels just like software vendors.  Once you get past Microsoft and Adobe who else is out there?  And what do they do about packaging?  You can hardly afford to buy a standalone version of their products since bundling makes them more attractive.  Fewer market-makers leads to fewer choices which means bigger profits for those who are left.

And finally, both industries built a wide chasm between the "artist" and the "buyer".  The infrastructure necessary to successfully run a package software business, or that of a record label are sizable.  You have distributors and resellers to pay-off.  You have gatekeepers to the market like radio stations and product reviewers.  You need to market, sell and support these complex products and supply chains; and of course, everyone wants to get paid along the way.  In the end the artist or developer got whatever was leftover.

Now, last month, we get the $0.99 software program – enter the App Store for the iPhone.  It was an epiphany for me.  Here on my phone, while I'm idling away a spare five minutes someplace I can find a little "one-hit wonder" of a software program, download and pay for it in a matter of seconds all for less than the price of soft drink at my local convenience store.  If it doesn't work out, so what?  It was only a buck.  Shamelessly I have to admit it, I have purchased more software (for me, not work) in the last week than I have in the last five years.  And I love it.

Has Apple done it again?  Did Apple reinvent the software business?  We're not even close yet but I see the signs pointing an interesting direction.  What does it mean for ad-based business models?  What does it mean to software development overall?  Do we just go and build really tightly targeted apps and sell them for a buck with the developer keeping 70 cents on the dollar for each product sold?  Why not?  Hmmm...   gotta run and go download the iPhone SDK.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How to be a Rebel, Just Like Me</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/rebel.jpg" alt="" title="rebel" align="right" />While I like to think my personality is both delightful and charming, occasionally it seems people think I'm just being a rebel. Sightings happen both in my personal and professional life and although I am not always consistent with my demeanor I certainly don't try to be difficult - at least all the time.  So here are my tips on how you can be a rebel just like me.

<strong>#1 Be right.</strong>  One could soften this and simply striving to be only opinionated but I don't think that completely nails it; you must confidently and consistently be right.  I normally (there are exceptions) mull things over privately for a long time.  I play devil's advocate with myself, try to see things impartially, view a situation from many different angles, reflect on what I've observed thus far and anticipate what might happen.  Then I take a position.  And once I've taken a stand I require solid reasoned argument to refute it.  There are many times I can recall of admitting my error but I can also recount many far many more times where I stood alone and to this day know I was dead right.

<strong>#2 Ask people to pick.</strong>  I've noticed this issue most frequently with managers I've worked for in my professional life.  Very often in business you are faced with competing priorities and limited resources.  My strategy for these situations has been to reassess goals and choose the objectives which can be achieved while deliberately choosing to not work those which are not achievable.  More often than not, you have to pick, and it seems people don't always like to have to do that.  And worse, some have the habit of reminding me of the things not accomplished to which I remind them we made a conscience choice to not do them.

<strong>#3 Work for the company, not your boss.</strong>  While we are on the topic of work, one of my favorite pieces of advice given to me during a performance review was, "Mike, remember you work your boss, not the company."  He was right but I have never been able to fully digest this concept.  I always go back to "what would the shareholders think?"  Being a manager is no assurance of right-minded thinking, clairvoyant nature nor sound decision-making abilities; I know, I've been one.  I've only worked for a few command and control type managers and thankfully for all parties affected it was short.

<strong>#4 Challenge conventional wisdom.</strong>  In part due to the pace of modern life, to stay ahead of the pack it is an imperative to challenge conventional wisdom.  I'd like to believe one of the reasons I have found a home in the technology industry is that the soul of this industry is about proving people wrong.  The conventional wisdom is "it can't be done" and all I can think is "like hell, watch this."  Go to nearly any meeting in corporate America and you can see the effectiveness of conventional thinking in action.  Too often organizations do something based on the momentum of the group but I like to challenge commonly held beliefs.

<strong>#5 Playing the contrarian.</strong>  It is not in my genes to be a lemming so instinctively I take to the opposite position of most groups.  When there is optimism I can often be found to be pessimistic; where there is despair I'm the first to find hope.  I don't know why I'm like this, I just am.  There is a method to my madness.  I'd like to believe having protagonists in a group makes the group better.

So there's my list.  Do people think you're a rebel too?

As some of you already know, I like to dig into the numbers.  Not financials and budgets per se, but demographics and adoption trends.  For firstly a marketeers' task is to persuade the audience of inevitabilities; not that the world can be different, but it will be.  That success is inevitable despite insurmountable odds.  It is simply the epitome of selling hope in a bottle.

One cannot ignore the ever growing adoption of Facebook, especially in the teen audience.  When will it's success become "inevitable?"

I've been following the age distribution of Facebook for the past few years and in particular the teen crown; given I have two kids in that demographic.  One question that did intrigue me was geographic differences: what state have the highest per capita adoption of Facebook among?  I did some digging and the numbers are surprising.

So which states comprise the top 10 in per capita usage of Facebook by teens?  High-tech hotbeds like California, Texas, North Carolina, Washington or Virginia?  No, the highest rank of these states is Virginia at #18.

The top ten in order are: District of Columbia, South Dakota, Connecticut, Missouri, Kansas, Massachusetts, Arkansas, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and New Jersey.  The list above is Virginia (#18), North Carolina (#25), Texas (#37), Washington (#39) and California (#42).

Think things are weird?  Per capita, Kansas has nearly three times more teens on Facebook compared to California.  Think that's a rural thing?  Not so.  Massachusetts boasts similar numbers compared to California.

The chart shows off the results.  Darker colors indicate highest adoption, lighter colors lower.  Enjoy.  If you'd like the spredsheet with the numbers, leave a comment]]></content:encoded>

		<title>An Election Observation (2008)</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/2008/09/an-election-observation/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/vote.jpg" alt="" align="right" />I have been interested in presidential elections since 1976.  It was a little odd, but yes, I basically watched every minute of both conventions that summer.  Ford and Carter.  Over the years my interest has ebbed and flowed but I always try to keep an eye on things.  The first election I voted in was 1980 having just recently attained voting age and I proudly cast my vote for John Anderson. I guess I was a contrarian even back then.

For me this year's election, for obvious reasons, is more interesting than the past several.  Over my 20 year or so career I've learned a lot about marketing, positioning, messaging and spin.  I know about talking points, media training the importance of a memorable quote.  And this year we have a bounty of back and forth.

But over the past week or so I've started to grow uncomfortable with the spectacle of the sport.  Crowds yell, hoop, holler, laugh and happily applaud razor sharp barbs tossed at opponents.  It seems the more personal, the better these days.  For some reason it's what we want to hear – a quick punch right in the kisser.

More alarming are the conversations I'm having with friends about the election.  I'm curious to hear what people think, why they do, and what they make of each party's ticket.  Even in crowds I would not expect it, resentment and divisions in our country are alive and well.  And it's not that we only disagree with one another it seems we find another's view inconceivable.  I actually think there are people out there who really do hate this candidate or another.  It feels personal and it saddens me.  We also know the media is no better and often they love to fuel the passions.

After reading just about everything I could get my hands on these past two weeks of conventions and all the points and counter-points made by the candidates, parties pundits and reporters I am disappointed no one has made a rather simple observation: no matter who wins, no matter who, a historical barrier will be broken.  In January we will either be inaugurating a person of African decent to the presidency or a woman to the vice presidency.  Gender and race will be a big step.

When I think about the election in this way I don't think any of us can loose since no matter what happens we all win.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Next Time it will be Different</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/2008/11/next-time-it-will-be-different/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/flag.jpg" alt="" align="right" />Tomorrow is election day in the U.S.  While there are many other races at stake, I think it's safe to say nearly every voter I know is sick of the entire presidential race.  Rather than talk about change or maverick behavior, here's my top five list of how next time it could be different.

1) Shorten the campaign season.  For goodness sake, narrowing down the field during the primaries shouldn't take so long.  It seems like the Democrats started nearly two years ago.  In addition to our sanity I'd like to ask a very simple question, what would your current employer do if you left you full-time job for nearly two years trying to get your next one?  I assume all the candidates still draw a paycheck from the U.S. or Alaskan government while they are out job hunting.  At a fundamental level this just seems wrong.  And if they really have that much free time, maybe they're getting paid too much in the first place.

2) Stop the hate.  Few things have depressed me more this year than to endure the name calling and negative campaigning.  Both candidates talked about change but whenever I turned on the TV I saw the same old thing.  Name calling, ridiculing, misrepresentations of voting records – both camps are guilty of the offense.  There was a moment in one of the debates when either candidate could have pledged to end the negativism but neither didn't.  If you believe in karma you have to agree neither candidate is going to have a smooth ride once they get into office.

3) Answers to questions.  Speaking of the debates, perhaps we could just have candidates vote yes or no before they give their long winded questions to the moderators.  Far too many times I got very irritated that neither Obama or McCain could not, or would not, answer a question.  My favorite, "Given the $700B bailout plan, what programs will you cut given this reality?"  Neither candidate gave a satisfactory answer in my book.  Maybe I've been through too many media training sessions but all I saw was rehearsed talking points and rarely a straight answer.

4) Spending limits.  It is absurd how much money is being spent to influence and get out the vote.  And what's terrifying, the fundraising numbers cannot match the incalculable number of volunteer hours contributed to the effort as well.  If Google can become a worldwide brand with little to no advertising why on Earth do candidates, at nearly every level, spend gargantuan dollars to advertise themselves.  With all the incredible innovation in social networking, social media and online connection we desperately need a version upgrade to the Candidate 2.0.

5) Outlaw yard signs.  It occurred to me last week that eventually all those fancy yard signs are going to end up in a land fill.  Oops.  I hope candidates who supports green initiatives don't print signs.  I did the math, if all the signs were made of paper (not all are), nationwide we destroyed 180,000 trees for yard signs.  So there is an environmental cost to the election as well.  I won't get into carbon emissions of travel, and on and on.  My recommendation, if you're running for federal office, ask your supporters to simply fly an American flag in their support.  Not only is it patriotic, doesn't destroy the Earth, but you can keep using it after your candidate wins or loses.

Bonus 6)  Let it go.  Practice acceptance and impermanence.  I have to believe there will be voting day issues but please, let's not see a repeat of 2004.  And whomever loses, remember our government is designed to correct itself.  The entire House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate will be back up for reelection in 24 months.  Then just 24 months after that we'll get to vote for President again.  Given the length of our campaign season, the losers shouldn't wait around too long to get started for the next time.  Or, as evidenced by Mr. Gore, there is life after politics which can include spoils like Board seats and Noble prizes.  Good for Mr. Gore.

Get out and vote.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Deja Vu it&#039;s 2002</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img title="horserace" src="http://mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/horserace.jpg" alt="" align="right" />Over the past six weeks I've noticed editors in the tech space looking to make a horse race out of OpenID and Facebook Connect.  Of course this makes for some interesting bylines and helps energize the public versus private identity discussion but the comparison is as misplaced at the one in 2002: Wi-Fi versus Bluetooth.

Back in 2002 the press, fresh off the browser wars, was looking for a new race to call.  Personal wireless was new, confusing and there were many standards vying for the hearts of engineers so it looked like a good candidate.  Bluetooth was way over-hyped, under-delivering on it's promise of ubiquity while a newcomer was making huge in-roads in capturing major design wins in the notebook market.

The US tech press was deeply familiar with the PC industry and had long ignored major developments in the mobile phone market.  Bluetooth was tearing up design wins in phones, which was delivering scores more users, but the press kept "the race" going – at least for a few years.  Then all of sudden someone finally figured out Wi-Fi was really about connecting devices to an IP network and Bluetooth was solely for connecting mobile devices to one another and the race was unceremoniously cancelled.  Bluetooth did not kill Wi-Fi and neither did the other; they have in fact lived happily ever after.

A few weeks ago Facebook released Facebook Connect and the coverage was deja vu to me. The technology includes several nice features but the one many in the press have mistakenly focused on is its "portable" identity.  Not only is this feature not the killer feature, it is not really portable at all – you can use your Facebook credentials to log into other sites.  And of course since only Facebook has the rest of your "identity" I'd expect it will be a long time they let it go much of anywhere.  So your Facebook identity is anything but portable.

However, by focusing on identity, the press have looked to compare Facebook Connect and OpenID.  And with comparisons naturally the question is asked, "who will win?"  So while the press looks to make a horse race of it, to me I have to say the two technologies are not comparable at all.

With OpenID, the user gets to decide where they would like to register their identity.  There is no central place or single site where someone can do this and in fact there are dozens of these "relying" parties.  While not part of today's specifications, I can easily imagine the OpenID initiative providing mechanisms where I might be able to choose to include and exclude a multitude of information that can be selectively shared with sites that implement the technology.  And since there will be competition, I can see some relying parties offering full "data portability" where others might take a more restrictive approach.

Facebook Connect is an attempt to expand the value of Facebook as the primary portal of the net generation.  Both the social and monetary value of Facebook I might add.  OpenID is the real deal, at least on paper, when it comes to portable identity.  Being an standards effort there is still much work left to achieving that promise; again a reminder of Bluetooth in 2002.  Where Bluetooth got usability right it has thrived (like in mobile phones and handsets) but where they were distracted it has essentially died (like the PC market except for a small selection of keyboards and mice).

My definition of a good comprise is one where neither party feels completely happy.  When a technology is developed that selfishly enriches a single party, one entity is happy but ultimately everyone loses.  Facebook Connect is fantastic and will provide value to those who's lives center around the social utility site.  OpenID is confounded with compromise but is best positioned to become the portable credentials of the web.  It will be fun to watch both technologies thrive and live a life happily ever after.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Thanks for checking out my link from Facebook.  This is what I'm about, trying new ideas in my current sandbox.  Today I'm in the social networking market and watching the latest trends here like micro-advertising on Facebook, OpenSocial, Community-driven marketing and the rest.  Six years ago I was chest deep in the personal wireless market leading the Bluetooth revolution from the other side of the table.  And six years before that I was trying to predict the future of component software.

For over twenty years I've been in the technology market; running out in front of the crowd and always trying to predict where we'll end up.  Not always, but more than most, I've been right.

<img id="image116" src="http://www.mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/memy.jpg" alt="memy.jpg"  align="right"/>My extensive product management and marketing experience help me to see industry from a realistic grounded perspective.  For a short while I even did sales so I'm well familiar with the buying and evaluation process for new technology.  I've led two trade groups learning along the way the value of and what it takes to get competitors to cooperate.

I ask questions and try to find the real story.  My extensive "quotable" public speaking experience worldwide helped to get my initiatives noticed.  I can be opinionated but never a bully.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-10000189" title="river" src="http://mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/river.jpg" alt="river" width="160" height="145" align="right" />As many of you know, for the past 20 or so years I've been enjoying an nice career in the technology industry.  Nice stops at the Bluetooth SIG, Apple, Intel, Iomega, iModules and few other startups along the way.  It has been a fantastic time and I have been fortunate to have a knack for something that also pays relatively well.

Since I was in my late 20's I had always dreamed of my turn as the founder of a high-tech startup.  It was going to be my fast ride on the big IPO/buyout fantasy of "never having to work again" – unless I wanted to.  Over the past 4-5 years I have come to the conclusion that this dream has passed me by while also growing disillusioned with the "toys for boys" mantra of new technology.  Lord knows I love new gadgets, but catching the next big thing, in my analysis, has become little more than catching the wind.  It is nothing.

About a year ago I was introduced to WaterPartners (water.org) through a good friend.  During a laid back casual lunch we talked about the state of technology, social networking and the direction of online engagement.  It was a good time and led to a fun proof of concept consulting project this past summer.  I didn't realize it would open a new chapter for my professional, and hopefully personal, life.

On 13-Feb I will be starting a new position with WaterPartners leading their marketing and individual donor engagement efforts.  I am humbled I've been given the opportunity to help them and terrified by the challenge.  The folks there do fantastic work – my job will be simply to focus a lens on their accomplishments and energize a community to support the effort.  If you haven't heard of them, WaterPartners delivers clean water projects in the developing world.  We in the western world might find it difficult to imagine how desperate this issue is in places like Eastern Africa and rural India but it very tragic.  As I learned more and more about their mission and philosophy, I could see how helping them would not only provide me new challenges but could also reshape my perspective on myself and others by doing something that matters.

Please don't mistake my story as being judgmental.  We all have our life journeys.  It is only because of my years of work in the tech market that I'm able to consider such an opportunity and certainly living in the midwest eases the transition.  I've also been very lucky to work on some very cool products and technologies over my career so in hindsight I really didn't miss a thing.  It's just time to start the next chapter of my life.

Keep an eye open to water issues over the coming few years.  If I'm up to the challenge you won't have to look very hard, it will be coming to you.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Incredible India</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img title="mm_women_communitypoint1" src="http://mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/mm_women_communitypoint1.jpg" alt="mm_women_communitypoint1" align="right" />The local tourism slogan here is “Incredible India”. It would seem to do a fair job of helping to inspire travelers to explore the deep richness and variety of Indian history and culture. While it is not tourism per se that brings me to India, it is to sample in the incredibleness that is India.

Home to over a billion persons, India is one of the more densely populated countries in the world to still maintain a traditional rural and bustling urban life. I am here to learn about the water crisis. I suppose most westerners would be surprised by this, since many consider the water crisis only an African issue. It is profoundly not.  In fact nearly two-thirds of those who lack access to safe water live in south Asia. And to my surprise, the number of Indians who lack access to improved sanitation is nearing double the number of people on the entire continent of Africa that lack these basic services.

But like anything, to really understand an issue, you have to peer behind the numbers and walk the streets to see it first hand.

Just yesterday, I visited four different urban slums here in Trichy, India. The conditions are visibly harsh, but the people I met didn’t seem troubled by their station in life. Here, many families will earn the equivalent of USD$2-3 per day, ususally for jobs such as loading trucks, working lower-end retail positions, selling small items, or providing other services or manual labor. This level of wealth will put these families in the “middle third” of the world’s poor and well ahead of the 10 percent of Trichy residents who live below these means. Many have bank deposits, and surprisingly, some own property – be that as it may. Most of the residences I visited were barely the size of a suburban American bedroom; five, seven or eight people, their belongings, and their entire livelihood fit inside this residence.

The water crisis here is unique. Over the past decade, municipalities have constructed massive water towers which are filled with river water and then redistributed to community water points throughout the slums. Usually 50-60 families will share a single water point – a single tap. We arrived early this morning to see water collection; as often is the case, water is only available from 6:30 a.m. to around 8 a.m. every morning. Women are only allowed to take three vessels for their family’s needs. If they don’t arrive early enough to take their place in line, they will go without for the day. Women here will spend two hours a day collecting water. These are actually comparably favorable conditions, considering what many others in India and other developing countries must endure.

Sanitation in the slums is what one might expect. There are community latrines which charge a one-rupee (about two-cent) use fee; however, every latrine I visited was without customers. I did see open defecation and other sewage flowing through the “gutters” of the slum into a nearby stream. So, I am unsure of the logic of charging people for latrine usage.

On the edge of town, water is provided via water tower or water lorry, the latter being a large tanker truck that delivers water on a set schedule to neighborhoods. We visited one such place today but discovered water is delivered only every other day, not this morning as expected.

Finally, I did see families enjoying the convenience of household water connections and latrines in the slums. These were provided through our WaterCredit initiative here in India. They still have schedule limitations but the convenience can save them hours a day compared to their fellow neighbors.

Given the nature of construction in these villages and the need for water pressure, the water connections are normally 1.5 to two meters below street level. As I visited these families, I was proudly ushered to a step-down cement area, normally just inside the front door, where women were happily filling water vessels. In groups of 12-15, these families (or, more accurately, these women) borrow money through microfinance institutions to finance a water connection. The terms are favorable and are often repaid prior to the loan term which is normally 12-18 months.

India is most certainly incredible.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Of Ants and Elephants</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/2009/12/of-ants-and-elephants/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img title="anant" src="http://mccamon.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/anant.jpg" alt="anant" width="150" height="150" align="right" />It's safe to say that since the dawn of the personal computer industry, tech marketing has been modeled after the theories of generalized technology adoption.  The advice: one should market to the early adopters and grow into the early majority of the bell curve of adoption over time being ever cognizant of the chasm between the two.

More recently folks like Malcolm Gladwell and others have gotten us to focus on the long tail, outliers and the edges of markets to find the connectors, tipping points and influencers.  Much of this work has celebrated social media and networks as proof these trends theories are correct and sound.

I'm beginning to believe we may have missed something in our rush to anoint the latest round of social scientists and their approach to using new media for marketing: ants.  Or should I say more specifically the immense size of small numbers.  So here's a tangent.  Some time ago I read that ants make up the largest cumulative biomass of species that walks the earth.  The problem with looking for the connectors makes us elephant hunters when maybe we should consider what would happen if we leveraged the strength of the ants.

Could it be that 1,000 complete nobodies impact a market more than one somebody in the age of new media?  Have we devolved to the rule of the mob?  Let's assume I have 150 friends on Facebook and 50 followers on Twitter and I decide to compose a glowing post about a movie I just saw.  Judging by what I've seen on these networks 3-4 people will comment on or like my post and then if flows out of sight in the stream of news for my friends.  What's interesting is the 3-4 people's comments will show up on their newsfeed which means their 150 of so friends will have access to my post.  In the end I can see that from my one post there's the potential of nearly 500 people hearing my voice.

So what?  Newspapers land on millions of doorsteps each morning.  Get to an editor, the elephant, and you're home free. Or maybe not.  If I go back to my previous story and use the 500 viewers of my comment and multiply that by the other 999 complete nobodies that made a similar comment we can see that 500,000 viewers have seen a similar post.  Yes, the paper gets delivered and you can use the old school "impressions" metric but in the end we all know a small percentage of those who get the paper will ever see a particular story.

I haven't been able to mathematically prove it but I'm beginning to think all the latest thinking on new media hasn't deeply internalized how it actually works in the wild. How many people are influenced by one person's comment on a social networking site?  I don't think the math is simple; rather I think it's quite nuanced.

In my day job I'm going to test the idea of marketing to the middle.  We are going to test the strength of ants.  I'll keep you posted on the outcomes.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[From my day job]

For the past several years, Water.org's social media engagement strategy has not only focused in growing online conversations but has also looked to leverage the Twitter API to quantify, measure, and manage these efforts.  Starting with a base of just under 2,000 followers in late 2009, @water now boasts over 375,000.

One recent example was our approach to supporting Blog Action Day in October of 2010.  Each year Change.org selects a global topic and promotes conversation in the blogsphere and in 2010 it was the water crisis.  Water.org saw this an opportunity to further extend its reach on social media channels while educating new audiences on how the water crisis impacts peoples' lives in the developing world.

By spending a few short hours with the Twitter API, we were able to develop a few simple applications to help us measure not only the reach of of the chatter on Twitter but also what conversations got the most traction.  It all started with encouraging the use of a hashtag for the campaign and @change selected #BAD10.  Our monitoring code checked the Twitter stream for use of this hashtag and logged each tweet.  A secondary application then collected basic user demographics of those who were posting these tweets.

Here are a few of our findings.  During the days leading up to Blog Action Day, the #BAD10 hashtag was used in over 5,200 tweets. We know that 20 of the top 25 tweets from that week were either authored by @water or retweets of our posts.  What got the most traction?  Not self-promoting fluff.  Tweets that included interesting and provocative facts about the water crisis like "More people have a cell phone than have a toilet" were by far the most retweeted during the campaign week.

By collecting user demographics of those tweeting we were able to established new mutually following relationships.  For instance, if someone tweeted for the campaign and had a quality following (not just "how many followers"), we followed them.  Nearly half that time, they followed us back.  In another study we did earlier in 2010 we found that when we followed influential folks who tweeted about the water crisis, fully 60% followed us.  Mind you, this wasn't auto-following, it was intentional-following that was data driven.  We believe that online there is "following capital" and because it has real value, we are deliberate who we follow. 

Given 17% of all tweets the week leading up to Blog Action Day either mentioned @water or were tweets of ours that were retweeted, we estimate Water.org made 18.9 million brand impressions in less than five days.  Not bad for a little bit of thoughtful planning ahead of time and a daily commitment to encourage a conversation.  Few, if any, other outreach efforts of Water.org have cost so little, performed as well, or were as measurable as Blog Action Day 2010.

We have reused many of these and other learnings, to inform our daily Tweets, how we select search terms for Promoted Tweets, and how we design future campaigns. While we continuously monitor the online chatter, we believe that by transforming that into actionable information we can extend the reach of our cause and build a following of people who want to solve the water crisis in our lifetime.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Why Steve was our Elvis</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Thousands of more respectful and talented writers will pen an eulogy for Steve Jobs. Many will recall his personality, belief system, impact on technology, and his business style and successes. Hopefully I’ll stand alone in comparing him to The King.

I broke the news earlier this evening to my good friend, who also happens to have been the primary reason I ended working at Apple in the 90s. Even though Steve was in exile most of our tenure, we talked like we had lost a friend. And even with the company only a few years away from it’s innovative-less darkest hours, the often-cited DNA was firmly still part of the Apple culture. We really did believe we were “changing the world one person at a time” and “the journey is the reward.”

For my mother's generation coming of age in the 1950s, Elvis Presley was the icon of change. While he borrowed ideas from others, he alone popularized them. While he was clearly full of talent, it was his style which overflowed. He broke the rules, smiled and others laughed along with him. He was going to do it his way, or not at all.

More importantly, like Elvis, a new pop culture emerged around his talent becoming something bigger; almost a reflection of how a generation lived, valued and thought about their life. No one knew exactly where they were going, but everyone wanted to get there.

My professional career began as the first personal computers were finding their way into the workplace. While the original Macintosh borrowed ideas from others, its execution felt remarkably new and it did in fact popularize the graphical user interface we use everyday. We didn’t know it then, but we were just starting the journey toward the persistently connected technology enriched mobile life many of us live today.

From his influence on mainstream entertainment (music, Disney, Pixar), and products like the Macintosh, iPod and now the iPhone, Steve Jobs became a icon that defined how my generation imagines, creates, communicates, collects, and shares it’s life with others and in that, in some ways how we value it. For many of us who worked in the technology industry, we didn’t want be like Steve Jobs, we wanted to be Steve Jobs.

I only had one uneventful three minute conversation with Steve Jobs back in 2003 and thanks to my mother I was drug to the LA Forum as a preteen and saw the King in concert. Both were flawed men. They left us in two absurdly different ways, but while they were here they bent the universe in a new direction. And like Elvis, Steve Jobs will ultimately be remembered as the first to leave the generation he defined.

Was the journey the reward? Funny, only they now know.

		<title>A Different Way to Social Network</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/2012/09/the-unsocial-network/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I can't really trace back to how this came to me the other week but it occurs to me that the next big social network should actually not be a social network at all. Everyone keeps trying to innovate by building new web experiences to compete with Facebook and Twitter.  In fact two of the higher profile efforts these days, Path and Medium, are from folks who were early purveyors of those two platforms. But alas, they've got it all wrong.

People don't need a better social network, they need a different way to social network.  What's broke? Firstly, whether they know it or not, most want control of their content. They want simple to understand concepts for managing who sees what.  They want to have a stable user experience. Ads make some people money, but rarely do we click on them, meaning we get served even more of them in more offensive presentations (really, when I zoom a photo in my timeline?). As brands and corporations, we want an ecosystem that we can build upon, not one that changes with a whim. Bottom line, we want control.

But the one thing that will kill an online experience, is the moment everyone figures out ultimately we are all simply along for the ride to justify a valuation.  It is not our social network, it is theirs. Theirs to change the user interface whenever they like. Theirs to change the terms of service whenever they like, and quite publicly in Twitter's case, it is theirs to change an entire partner ecosystem whenever they like.  Now of course we all clicked the checkbox and said "okay" but that doesn't prevent us from saying "goodbye" as well.

Where would we all go and what would we all do? If I had the money, talent, and the time I know what I would do. I would take a page from the early days of messaging and invent the next social network.

In 1992 if you weren't a super smart university professor or scientist and you wanted to send electronic mail to people you got an account on AOL or CompuServe. These dialup services took the community concepts of bulletin board systems (BBSs if you're too young) and gave them rich user experiences and simple electronic messaging. Unfortunately it was next to impossible for a good while to share messages with people on another system which at that time also included Prodigy, AppleLink and a few others I've long forgotten. We all lived in wall gardens, or islands. Pick your metaphor.

What changed? We grew up. With the growing momentum for standards like SMTP and POP, companies could build and others could easily install their own mail servers, connect them to the internet, and then people could exchange messages between desperate electronic messaging systems. The citizens of the system grew up and realized a better system was where they were in control, able to define how it worked for them. Some companies set up free web-based email systems like Hotmail and over time more and more email clients became available (along with IMAP) so that today you can use Mail on an iPhone 5 and easily exchange messages with people … still on AOL.

The next social network should be a collection of new standards, not too different from IRC, SMS, SMTP, and IMAP that allow anyone to create new "social network server" applications on which users create accounts to store their content and their social graph. The same or other companies can build new "social network clients" that connect to any and all standards-based social network servers on the web.  Our content would live where we want, our user experience would be how we want it -- maybe free ad-supported, but maybe for a few bucks I get out of that jail. My client could connect to any social network I wanted. In fact, maybe like email, I could have a place to host personal social network content and graph, and a completely different place for my work identity.

Contrary to what most people think, standards-based ecosystems spur innovation and this change would be no different. Why couldn't a mobile carrier build a social network server that directly interfaces with an SMS backend? Maybe someone figures out a way to merge the concept of an email server with a social network server? Could someone solve the email spamming problem with simply a social graph? Maybe someone could figure out a commerce system that allows creators to get compensated for the content they create. And in the strangest of ironies, maybe someone creates a new social network client that consumes and creates content for a hosting company like Facebook?

We don't need a better social network, we need a different way to social network.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The rules have changed. We need a new way to think about spreading messages in our online world. The ongoing diffusion of technology continues to reshape what we as a society discover, learn, create, and share. For my parents' generation Walter Cronkite helped to shape our conversations; today that is determined by the Attentive Class. How to think about our new world? The Attention Manifesto.
<ol>
	<li>The rarest natural resource of western life is attention.</li>
	<li>Attention is the currency of the online world.</li>

	<li>Those with the highest disposable attention are among the Attentive Class.</li>
	<li>The Attentive Class consumes, creates, and curates our world's news.</li>
	<li>Unlike traditional segmentation, the Attentive Class defy age, gender, and education.</li>
	<li>The velocity of memes are directly correlated to its appeal for the Attentive Class.</li>
	<li>"Celebrity" is transforming for in today's online world, we are all famous for 15 friends.</li>
        <li>Genuine communicators sharing heartfelt narratives trump hysterical narcissists.</li>
	<li>Mobile presents new opportunities to monetize boredom in the attention economy.</li>
	<li>This is not new. What has changed is the ongoing diffusion of connectedness.</li>

<p><em>Why SpiderOak made a conscious decision to break up with Analytics</em></p>
<figure class="wp-caption">

<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Most reports indicate Google has over 70% share of the analytics marketplace. Does that jeopardize our privacy?</figcaption></figure><p>After we gave it some more thought, we realized we were hypocrites. Since inception, SpiderOak has been an advocate for online privacy. Unlike many others in our market, we strive to be very clear about how our product design truly delivers Zero Knowledge privacy for our users. We tell potential supporters, what matters most is who has the keys and how they are stored. But you can read more about how we solved those problems from our many other posts <a href="https://spideroak.com/about/our-passion" target="_blank">our site</a>.</p>
<p>For the past five years, we had been using Google Analytics for monitoring our web traffic. Innocent enough decision, right? Then we asked ourselves, “are we contributing to the mass surveillance of the web by using a feature-rich, yet free service that tracks web visitors?” Sadly. we didn’t like the answer to that question. “Yes, by using Google Analytics, we are furthering the erosion of privacy on the web.”</p>
<p>Most people might say, “well it’s only a cookie,” or “I don’t have anything to hide.” Yes our site is only one short stop you might make today while browsing the web, but why does Google and their advertisers need to know about it I would ask. Most of us visit scores of websites each day. The fabric behind the scenes that stitches a stunningly detailed history of your online day is Google Analytics. <strong>Even if you don’t have a Google account</strong>, or don’t stay logged into Gmail, y<strong>our browsing history every single day is tracked</strong> across sites that include the JavaScript library.</p>
<p>So a few months ago we decided we were wrong and Google Analytics had to go.</p>
<p>Like lots of other companies with high traffic websites, we are a technology company; one with a deep team of software developer expertise. It took us only a few weeks to write our home-brew analytics package. Nothing super fancy yet now we have an internal dashboard that shows the entire company much of what we used analytics for anyway - and with some nice integration with some of our other systems too.</p>
<p>Some of us still have Gmail accounts and others keep using Chrome. Google makes good products. But where SpiderOak decided to draw the line was with the privacy of our current and soon to be customers. You deserve a choice when it comes to privacy online and we realized we could do better by not contributing to your browsing history with Google. And now that we’ve fixed that, we can sleep at night.<br>Be safe out there.</p>

		<title>The Grand AdWords Heist</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/2015/12/the-grand-adwords-heist/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p><em>“The Internet can feel like a dark, dangerous, syringe-filled alley”</em></p>
<p>I have always been skeptical of the value that online advertising brings to a company. And in particular, paid search like Google AdWords. If you haven’t given it a try it’s pretty simple: create your ads, define a budget, and determine a bid price for search terms. The results are instantaneous and site traffic is impressive, thanks to Google’s network.</p>
<p>So on October 21st we jumped in. SpiderOak setup a modest budget with the intention to test our way to the best search terms and then in 2016 we would expand the scope of our use of Adwords to help drive conversions of our backup product, SpiderOakONE. By mid November we turned off Google AdWords for good and completely abandoned the idea of paid search.</p>
<p>Why? Because of the Great AdWords Heist. Over our 21 days experiment Google reported 10,535 clicks on our ads. But our website analytics were only reporting 5,951 visits to our site. That’s right, Google was reporting nearly DOUBLE the number of clicks what we were able to verify came to our site. Wait a second. SpiderOak just spent $1,168.01 and nearly half of those clicks didn’t result in a visit? If there’s one thing I’ve learned in my 25+ years in business it’s that if something smells like bullshit, it usually is bullshit.</p>
<p>Google AdWords offered this explanation in their documentation; “A click is counted even if the person doesn’t reach your website, maybe because it’s temporarily unavailable. As a result, you might see a difference between the number of clicks on your ad and the number of visits to your website.” Bullshit. Our site was certainly not unavailable.</p>
<p>Just as we did our due diligence with AdWords testing, I dug into Google AdWords Reporting — which I can report is pretty nice — and was able to learn a little bit more about the numbers. Seems that that over 85% of our clicks were coming from the Google Display Network (not Search) and well over 50% of the clicking was happening in Romania, Brazil, Pakistan, India, Vietnam, Burma, Saudi Arabia, Kosovo, Philippines and Bangladesh. After a bit of sorting and filtering of the data I get another surprise, only 30 of our 10K+ clicks were from the US. When I compare all this info with our analytics data I see that most of the UIDs (unique identifiers of those who click) have more than one click — in fact most have dozens and several are over a hundred. Why would the same people keep clicking on the same ad?</p>
<p>There are good people in those countries but I have no idea why they’re clicking that often on ads that are written in English. Staring at this data I was reminded of the lively conversations about click fraud back in the early days on online advertising. Like everyone else I was confident all the issues had gotten sorted out before we moved onto more important problems like self-driving cars but then again… Bullshit.</p>
<p>Maybe we set AdWords up wrong. Maybe I’m reading the data incorrectly. Maybe our website was offline when 43% of people tried to visit it from far off places around the world. Maybe we were suckers who hadn’t a clue. Maybe I’m a complete idiot. Or maybe we were another victim of the AdWords Heist.</p>
<p>The online world can be a dark, dangerous, syringe-filled alley. Just the sort of place in the real world we might expect to get robbed. No matter off or online, safety does boil down to trust. In the offline world, we can visit the shop or have an in person meeting with a business owner to get a read on if we might choose to trust them or not. Online, it’s mostly slick marketing speak, corporate proclamations, and complicated terms of services. Mostly all bullshit.</p>
<p>Was it a heist? I don’t really know and I don’t really care. For SpiderOak, we now understand the value that online advertising brings to the organization, and it ain’t much. Mostly I feel like someone robbed $500 from us and we will never use AdWords ever again. We need to feel safe again online. Perhaps I should start rethinking who I trust as I navigate all these dark alleys.</p>

		<title>Privacy: Social Cause or Business Imperative?</title>

<p><em>Does your company have NDAs or Confidentiality Agreements? If you do, then your company understands privacy is a business imperative.</em></p>
<p>For most of us, privacy is a social cause; a way of life that protects a basic civic liberty. But online privacy isn’t just a social cause. It’s also a business imperative. And encryption is one of the easiest ways to protect our livelihood. But first back to business imperatives…</p>
<p>Does your company lock the front door at night? Does it have locks on personnel files? Does your company have non-disclosure agreements? Does it have confidentiality agreements for vendors and employees? Does it secure the WiFi network with a password? Do you need a password to login to email?</p>
<p>If you answered “Yes” to any (and I bet you answered “Yes” to all) of these questions, your workplace understands the business imperative of privacy. You don’t have to be Silicon Valley startup or Apple to be paranoid about the future of your business. These privacy policies are designed to protect the company, its assets, your stockholders, and frankly your own job and livelihood.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest, most businesses shouldn’t be that worried about hackers, foreign operatives, and compromised credit card records. It’s the other very real things that will more likely kill your business or/and ruin your career, things like theft, corporate espionage, ransomware, litigation from former employees, and workplace morale. Also don’t forget information leakage from BYOD, mobile, and the informality of most electronic conversations. The volumes and volumes and volumes of plain text information shared, discoverable, and hosted in the cloud will be the next gold rush for litigators. Just ask Sony or <a href="http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/03/what-hulk-hogan-taught-me-about-slack.html" target="_blank">Gawker</a> .</p>
<p>Yes, corporate privacy is more than IT security. It is everything the company does after it secures the network with taller walls and wider moats. Encryption of business information is the simplest and best method of protection. And many argue if your data is encrypted and unreadable by any actor, either inside or outside your network, you can always sleep at night knowing you are safe again.</p>
<p>Privacy is a 7x24 business imperative. We need to move away from “Do you care about privacy?” and move toward “What are you going to do today to better protect your business?”</p>

		<title>The Rise of the Attentive Class</title>

<p>How did you find this article? When it comes to the latest news, where did you go to find it?</p>
<p>I’ve done a fair amount of research on the velocity of messages on social media. My goal was to efficiently leverage and in some cases, game sites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, to raise awareness for the international water crisis. Much of what I saw helps explain how machine-curated news and social media have changed what we know and when we know it but has also pushed us into our own black hole of agreeable viewpoints.</p>
<p><strong>Walter is Gone. </strong>While certainly imperfect in his perspective and inclusiveness, when I was a kid Walter Cronkite curated the news. Okay not all the news, but metaphorically. Back then our news was discovered, researched, and reported by career professional journalists like Walter Cronkite. A good deal of news went unreported due to network news cycles and personal biases, but at least there was a professional filter. Today, most (all) online news is curated by algorithms which serve stories based on how many people have already clicked on them. If lots of people click, that news goes to the top of the feed. Is it fake news? Hell, the machines don’t care — they are just counting clicks. On platforms like Facebook, the most clicked posts show up in more of your friends’ feed. It’s technically democratic but certainly distorted in some very bad ways.</p>

<blockquote>Machine-curated news and social media have created a seismic shift in how we know what we know.</blockquote>

<p><strong>Attention is Wealth. </strong>Online, attention is the currency that fuels the marketplace. In a world where clicks and views increases advertising revenue and time-on-site metrics, everyone is striving to get you on their site for as long as possible to consume and hopefully click on advertisements. This fact is well covered ground but from an economic point of view, this only looks at half, the supply side, of the equation. If attention is the currency of the web, demand is being driven with people with free time — unused attention. Who are the most wealthy “buyers” in the market? People with the most disposable attention. From what I’ve observed “time spent online just surfing the web” when plotted against a viewers age on a graph looks like an inverted bell curve. Generally, young and old have more disposable time than busy midlife folks. The marketplace responds to demand; and this new Attentive Class are more interested in Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, obsessing over lost emails, immigration, and the (perceived) demise of American Greatness. The busier midlife folks simply didn’t have as much time to spend finding stories that make us Stronger Together.</p>
<p><strong>Follow the Money. </strong>Someone needs to call it like it is: Facebook, Twitter and Google are NOT technology companies — they are media networks. At their heart, the only material difference between Facebook and Disney, or Twitter and ABC, Fox News or Google and the New York Times, is their method of delivering content. They are beholden to advertisers because it is their primary revenue model; monetizing attention. There was a time when your Facebook timeline was mostly organic, but algorithms specifically designed to deliver higher profits to Facebook changed all that. I personally saw the drastic drop in follower “views” of branded content unless brands boosted posts with advertising. The predominate business model of our mainstream internet companies is monetizing your attention and data. And they share a lot. Put something in your Amazon cart and later visiting Facebook watch an ad for that very product magically appear.</p>
<p><strong>Nobodies and Somebodies.</strong> One of the more interesting quantitative research projects I did several years ago was to answer the question, “How many nobodies online does it take to have the same influence of one somebody?” The answer is 334. If 334 nobodies (people with &lt;150 followers) tweeted the same thing, they got more click thrus than one somebody (account with &gt;500,000 followers). If you’re interested in the research email me but the short explanation is we had a platform that posted over 300,000 tweets over a variety of different campaigns and timelines, each with custom URLs, and all we needed to do was measure click backs comparing nobodies and our somebody. Mobilize the mob, and your voice is louder than the prognosticators.</p>
<p>Technology improves our lives in immeasurable ways each and every day. I’ve been lucky enough to build a long career in tech so I’m a big, big fan. But sometimes there are real unintended consequences of progress. I cancel my subscription to the newspaper to read it online and media companies go away, I shop online and I hurt local working class shop owners, we click on fantastical headline while the Attentive Class curates our news feed.</p>
<p>I’ll close with one of my favorite lines from the move <em>Gladiator</em>. “Rome is the mob. Conjure magic for them and they’ll be distracted. Take away their freedom and still they’ll roar. The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the senate, it’s the sand of the coliseum.” And now in 2017 it’s clicks in cyberspace. What we know, and how we learn about it has changed in drastic ways this past decade. Are we being ruled by the mob — by the Attentive Class? What would Walter say about all this? My guess is matter of factually, “And that’s the way it is, Monday, February 20, 2017. Good Night.”</p>

		<title>Six everyday technologies that would change our Democracy</title>

Like many of you, I too have contacted my members of Congress with an opinion or concern about pending legislation or topics that matter to me. You know the drill: write a letter, or more common of late, make a phone call. During the first few months of this year when I called, the most likely result was a busy signal or a full voice mailbox.

<p>We deserve better.</p>
<p>Why is it acceptable that it is easier for my teenager to like a stranger’s funny cat video on YouTube when she’s riding along with me in the car, than for us to participate in our democracy sitting in our own homes? How is it I can know my Uber/Lyft driver will arrive in two minutes, but I have no earthly idea what my Representative is doing today, this week, last month — ever?</p>
<p>Basically our democracy has failed to creatively implement technology to engage us as constituents, voters, and advisers. Lots of nonprofits have mastered this, but right now it seems like our feedback systems for Congress are more designed to suppress and limit comment than engage us in the democracy. Maybe it’s by design.</p>

<blockquote>We don’t need a wall in America, we already have one around our government. Technology can tear down the wall between the government and the governed.</blockquote>

<p>So here are six, very low tech, technologies I’d love to see on my Representative’s website. Ya’ listening Mr. Yoder?</p>
<p><strong>Online Calendars.</strong> What is my representative doing this week? Who are they meeting with, what legislation are they working, are there committee meetings to attend, and what’s coming up for votes on the floor? Most of what we get today is backward looking fluff. I’m sure you keep your calendar electronically so it’s really only a permissions and publishing setting. What I’m imagining is something that gives me a real-time view into what’s coming next.</p>
<p><strong>Shared Notes.</strong> And when you get done with those meetings, it would be great if you posted notes online for everyone to review. I know this is frighteningly transparent, but you do work for me. So just like when I send a staffer to a meeting I expect to see notes, same goes for you.</p>
<p><strong>Biweekly Vlogs</strong>. No less than twice a week I’d like to see a short video or podcast (think less than two minutes) on something coming up in Congress. It would be a great way to explain complex issues and a way to share insight as to why my representative plans to vote in this way or another. No script, no rehearsal. Just first person, authentic and no bullshit talk on a very regular basis. Teenagers have mastered vlogging, so can you.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Up Legislation.</strong> UX would be hard but maybe something like Medium where my representative could post a pending bill, write comments and then open it up for responses from constituents. If you’re looking for a research project go figure out what legislation is pending this week, what’s your congressional delegations view and what gaps of knowledge would they like to find to be better informed. Let me know what you find.</p>
<p><strong>Constituent Polls. </strong>Suppose there’s an important (they all are) vote coming up in the House this week. Wouldn’t it be great to have a way to be notified of that pending vote and then a way I could vote through a poll online? It could be more subtle than Yes/No, but that would be good to know as well. I’m not talking about it being binding, just some quick directional feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Scalable POTS</strong>. Okay this isn’t really a current “everyday technology,” but the architecture behind it’s design is quite everyday for most internet apps: virtualization. Getting ready to launch a big ad campaign, toss up a few AWS instances with a load balancer to handle the load. Design systems to automatically scale during high use. A phone number is simply a POTS (plain old telephone system) endpoint and could (with the proper design), never be busy.</p>
<p>With most of these, you’d have to implement some sort of authentication system to ensure you don’t get gamed by bots or trolled by folks out of your district, but that’s okay because with this level of access, constituents can incur a bit of inconvenience.</p>
<p>I suppose we need to keep the phones and email but my thinking is that if I had more engaging ways to connect with my government, I wouldn’t use them as much — and I’d likely feel more engaged and fulfilled. Reflect on your own life: are you more likely to post something on Facebook for a whole bunch of your friends to see or send a long email to each one of them?</p>
<p>The economics of journalism today means that most of the 535 members of Congress can quietly, and without much supervision, do whatever they wish far away from the visibility of their constituents. They can blockade our input with full voicemail systems or with something as easy as a busy signal. They can refuse to host town halls and not take our appointments. This is flat wrong. We don’t need a wall in America, we already have one around our government. We deserve better.</p>

		<title>Making Privacy Obvious to Everyone</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/2017/06/making-privacy-obvious-to-everyone/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Privacy and User agreements: We agree to them without a single thought and certainly never ever read them. Let’s start with a quick background. Since the early days of the software industry — like the days when software came in boxes — users were presented with a legal agreement to use software. It is not uncommon for the legal documents to ramble on and on for pages. All you really need to know is there’s a good chance that “you’re on your own” if you use the software.

Fast forward to the internet age. Since virtually every app or service we use today is free, software companies came up with a Privacy Agreement that basically gives them permission to use your data in unprivate ways. Monetizing user data is THE business model of the internet age so as the saying goes, “if the product is free, then you are the product.” Use Facebook, and all that data about you is used by Facebook to sell ads. Same for Google, Twitter, YouTube, and on and on. By the way this extends to “apps” like Amazon where your Shopping Cart contents are widely shared with ad networks.

If people actually realized what was going on with their privacy, they might change their behavior. There are three primary questions users should want answered by these types of agreements:
<ol>
 	<li>Can the service provider ever read my data or is it encrypted?</li>
 	<li>Where is my data stored? On my device, in the cloud, or both?</li>
 	<li>Does the service provider monetize my data?</li>
</ol>
Why not come up with a simplified labeling requirement for internet service agreements? This idea could be used for ISPs, your mobile carrier, the apps you use online, and then all the way down to the search engine you use.

Each of three questions have two or three states so it’s a pretty simple iconography problem. Above is a terrible sketch of what I’m thinking. I bet with no other info, you can figure out which one is Facebook and which one is a my Alarm Clock. Put it at the top of the agreement and allow new users to read the entire agreement if they want, but at least they would get the top-level questions answered before they start using the product.

Would this idea make privacy more obvious to the masses? For the longest time if you wanted nutritional information at places like McDonald’s you had to request what was a very large foldout poster of mountains of information. I’m sure it cost McDonald’s a fortune to print and keep these things in stock in thousands of locations. Today, their menu above the counter already includes the key metric you’re mostly likely wanting to know: calories. And yes, that info has changed my behavior. I don’t get to McDonald’s often, but it’s a real drag that my favorites are obviously the worse for me as well.

Legislation might be required to get providers to make this change. I’m okay with that. Users have a right to know, and I also believe vendors have the responsibility to transparently disclose how they use my data. It was my data in the first place.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Five Things We All Deserve in Our Work</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/2018/09/five-things-we-deserve/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10000535" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/IMG_0040-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" />For the first time in a while I’m on the job market looking for my next opportunity. I’m excited and I have a good deal of flexibility when it comes to compensation and the role but there are a few “really want to haves” wherever I might land over these next few months. So here is my list of "Five Things We All Deserve in Our Next Career."

<strong>Work with a Purpose.</strong> I’m spoiled. I love working on projects that keep me awake at night - projects that stir my passion and heart. Don’t mistake this means I can only work for nonprofits. In fact, many of my for-profit stops had a mission focus in their work: Apple “think different”, Bluetooth “connecting the world without wires”, and even SpiderOak “encrypt everything.” All of these are in addition to Water.org, a true cause, “safe water and the dignity of a toilet for everyone in our lifetime.” Make the mission bigger than one product or the next sale, and your staff will respond.

<strong>Big Challenges.</strong> I’m at my best when I’m trying to solve a big challenge. The way I think, my approach to planning and brainstorming all make me more effective when trying to move an entire market, as opposed to getting a narrow market of prospects to buy one thing. When I look back on Bluetooth, I see that was a very big challenge. Back in 2002 the future of Bluetooth was very much uncertain; it took a great team to avoid failure and make room for the success we see today. Big challenges are the ones worth solving.

<strong>Embracing Risk.</strong> When it comes to growing a business if you do the same things as everyone else, how can you expect any different results? You can’t. A cause/product/company can only grow if the leadership is willing to embrace and encourage measured risk-taking. It’s the “fail fast, fail often” mantra of the technology industry. But I would add, take ten average sized risks on projects/ideas is WAY better than taking one with a lot more risk. As a marketer, think of yourself as a venture capital firm: invest a small amount in ten deals expecting one to work and nine to flame out instead of a one investment and hope to get lucky. Stick your neck out, you will do better than you think .

<strong>Partner Engagement.</strong> Most every big problem I’ve worked on needed a partner strategy to be effective. Let’s face it, in today’s world there are very few big problems that can be solved by one team or one company. Much of the marketing success of Water.org was built on partnerships. We worked with other nonprofits, press, Hollywood, and of course the big social platforms Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to affordably tell the world about the water crisis, and how together we could solve it for good. There is some art in doing this well and it starts with thinking of how your partner can benefit from the partnership before you do.

<strong>Autonomy, Transparency &amp; Trust.</strong> I expect my staff to do what we plan to do and I fully plan to the same for my management. It's crushing to me when I get micro-managed. My best results come from building a plan, getting management to buy off on that plan, and then having the autonomy to get things done. I'm cool with benchmarks and metrics, checkins, and course corrections, but I like to have the room to think, do, and innovate. There have been several projects in my career that spanned multiple years and required patience and long term commitment to a distant goal. You have to have patience to see a plan through to the end. Don't worry, I'll let you know if I need help, but please don't stop by desk every day asking me if I'm done yet. We want to be trusted to do the right thing.

So that’s my list. Notice compensation, title, stock options, work location, dress codes, free food, vacation policies and the like aren’t on the list. We all want more than that; give us something more and we will respond with our time, passion, and commitment.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Five Ways Automattic Could Make WordPress the Bomb for Activists</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/2018/10/five-ways-automattic-could-make-wordpress-the-bomb-for-activists/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Every movement needs an online presence. A place to tell their story, their action plan, and how to connect and organize around the cause. Historically, the online world provided a safe haven to do all this, and recruit new supporters to your work.

<strong>But that all changed.</strong> Activists are not technologists and without changes we’re in deep trouble.

Generally what we all do online in the US is governed and protected by the First Amendment. Just a few weeks ago the US Justice Department requested Dreamhost, an internet website hosting company, release “all records and information” relating to the site disruptj20.org and more specifically the IP addresses of those who visited the site. For those less technical, that would be like the Justice Department requiring Target to supply the CC# of every person who walked into the store even if they didn’t buy anything. At its most innocent, it’s a witch hunt. At its more sinister, its something out of the sci-fi movie Minority Report where police can arrest you before you even commit a crime.

WordPress is used by 29% of all websites online. My guess is a fair number of those sites are used by activists - <em><strong>INCLUDING disruptj20.org (http://disruptj20.org/wp-admin)</strong></em>. This means Automattic, the company behind WordPress.com and the WordPress codebase, could make five simple changes that would make WordPress the bomb for activists online.

<strong>1. Never, ever keep log files.</strong> One reason why the Justice Department can get so many juicy facts about visitors, etc is virtually every website on the web maintains, and saves log files. Think of it as list of every visitor, page visited, admin login, and on and on - all timestamped with the web location you were at when you connected, what browser you use, your screen size and so forth. I can’t speak for Automattic, but most places don’t have a tidy log file management policy meaning quite often log files are kept into perpetuity. Log files are handy for troubleshooting errors, but maybe the WordPress Admin could expose a setting on how long to keep log files - something like never, hourly, daily, monthly, etc.

<strong>2. Replace Google Analytics.</strong> When it comes to knowing about your website traffic, there isn’t a super awesome replacement for Google Analytics. The team at Automattic could on their own, or maybe approach a partner, build a simple replacement for Google Analytics. Not only could it be more careful with data storage history, but it could also be an data island not connected the Google mainland of data sharing. If you have analytics installed on your site, Google knows a lot about your visitors - and could potentially be asked, like Dreamhost, to provide it to the government.

<strong>3. Encrypt user data.</strong> Most all the data stored in a WordPress instance is stored in plain-text. Okay, except maybe some passwords. “Plain-text” simply means data is stored in a way that is human readable without any decryption. It’s like the number on the front of your credit card not the encrypted data in your chip on your credit card. Minimally WordPress should encrypt user data; especially email addresses of admins, authors and the like. And WordPress should include a library so plugin developers can encrypt data they collect as well before it get stored into the database.

<strong>4. Business, Personal or Activist.</strong> When you first setup a WordPress blog, a step in the wizard to help you find the right theme is the choice of Business or Personal. WordPress should add an Activist option that would increase security posture of the site (like requiring 2-factor authentication), enable all the features above, and create elevated requirements for Automattic employee access to the site.

<strong>5. Curriculum and Mentoring.</strong> WordPress provides a good deal of curriculum, FAQ, guides, and help files to help the world blog. Automattic could provide additional curriculum to advocates about the precautions they should take when administering an advocacy site online and with WordPress. As we’ve seen over the past several years, journalists are under increased threat by governments around the world. WordPress is a publishing platform, and therefore its users are amateur journalists.

I’ve been using WordPress for more than a decade to host my website. I have launched several corporate sites on the platform as well. It is a very approachable tool that improves the health of the web, our conversations online and our lives. There is a good chance I missed a few idea or perhaps some of it is in the works. My goal here is to help start the conversation.

WordPress is used around the world by folks living under oppressive regimes and cultural censorship. Automattic: Let’s help to protect the next generation of advocates as they find their way online.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Why Imperfect is so Perfect</title>
		<link>http://mccamon.org/2018/10/why-imperfect-is-so-perfect/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When trying to solve a problem, exploit a new opportunity, or hire someone for your team, too often we look for the perfect solution. I feel like this is one of our core human resourcing issues these days when faced with a deluge of applicants, bots and filters keep candidate pools manageable. Or when it comes to solving a challenge we get blocked by getting everything right instead of just getting started.

Let me make the argument that usually the imperfect option is usually the perfect one.

<strong>Problem Statement.</strong> Figuring out the solution to problems first normally involves defining the problem statement. This is where the team, or yourself, look to exhaustively clarify and articulate the problem, its causes, factors, and then brainstorm potential solutions. The problem is, very, very few of us, if any, can leave our biases to the side and get it right. Most of the time you can get 80-90% right, but rarely 100%, and it might just be the last 20% that makes the entire problem look different. It we can’t fully articulate the problem, our perfect solution won’t be a fit.

<strong>Delays Getting Started.</strong> There’s a reason the tech industry loves the mantra, “fail fast and fail often” is that it inspires action without complete information. More than any other industry, tech’s most limited resource is time (by the way as mortal humans, it’s ours as well). So if you wait until you find the perfect solution the market has moved on and often you’re left in the dust. You’re going to learn a whole bunch more through iteration than analysis, so get some basic instructions and jump head first into the deep end. Spend six months waiting for the perfect candidate to walk in the door and you’re now six months behind on the task/project/product that person was going to solve.

<strong>Things Change.</strong> Even if you could come up with a perfect solution, as you start to implement and live with your decision, the world keeps changing. Most of the time change is slow but when you look at things over longer horizons you can see they change a lot. One good example would be our use of Facebook. How much has your usage changed in the last month? Probably not much. What about five years ago? What about ten years ago? Back in 2007, most millennials were still in high school and I’m sure they’re embarrassed by how much Facebook influenced their life. Now they don't use it so clearly things change a lot. So even if you could find the perfect solution today, it might not work in a year, or five years from now. Take the long view. Hire someone that works today and well into the future.

<strong>Past is not the Future.</strong> Looking at your historical data doesn’t help you see the future - it only helps you to understand the past. If you’re good at marketing it’s easy to see that causality is difficult, if not impossible, to prove. Run one ad and see the result. Run the ad again and get a different result. The market doesn’t live in a petri dish and is nuanced and fickle. There are thousands of factors that impact the conversion rate of an email. At the macro level there’s the messaging, the design, the call to action. At the micro level there’s “what I’m doing when I look at this email”, what’s my current mood, or it is a busy part of my day. Your next job is different from your past ones. Everything is different except the name on your business card.

<strong>Innovation Lives in the Fringes.</strong> In my view the most important reason to avoid the perfect “solution” is that innovative ideas usually live on the fringes of the obvious. Perfect candidates for a particular role do have a great deal of historical knowledge that helps them quickly diagnose a situation and come up with a quick solution. But without humility, an over-confident solution often results in peril. Sometimes knowing less is better than knowing it all. Knowing less means you’re more likely to explore unconventional ideas, try something completely new, and might just find a completely new growth strategy. When I joined Water.org, knowing virtually nothing about grassroots fundraising, we explored a good many unconventional ideas. One of which was to in fact NOT ask for money. And every year I was there, we raised more and more money. When I joined Bluetooth the conventional wisdom was we needed to better engineer interoperability. But my fringe idea was to use analyst relations and PR to create demand in the consumer market for interoperable products confident that overtime this would lead to success. Hundreds of millions of Bluetooth enabled and interoperable products later, show that unconventional idea was correct as well.

The world is imperfect. I’m imperfect, you’re imperfect, your company’s imperfect - and that’s all okay. As I navigate this career search I’m looking for an imperfect place to work, that’s willing to take a chance on me just the way I am. I have a great deal of expertise at nonprofits, tech, growing organizations, public relations, marketing, leading great teams, plus a lot more but I’m far from perfect - and humble enough to know that too.

All of which means we’re perfect for each other.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For the better part of my life I have had great success moving onto the next (often higher) role on my career path. I tell folks it has unfolded like a three act play - the problem is I don’t like the plot twist of the third act. But more on that later.

Nine months and five days ago the company eliminated my role. It was part of a larger downsizing (about 40% of staff ultimately including the founder) as the startup struggled to stay afloat. That’s fine. We did some great things and made some mistakes but in hindsight it’s hard to grow a technology company without new products. The “campground” was cleaner than I found it, so I sleep at night.

I figured that the transition would be pretty easy, hell, I have like 30+ years of experience and much of it very interesting and unique. I’ve been filling time with some pro bono and paid consulting, networking, and even more networking, applying for roles online, then hunting down hiring managers and emailing (and calling) them directly - repeatedly. But the results of my “job search” work product have been, shall we say, unfulfilling.

<strong>Older candidates get the shaft because their future career narratives look uncertain.</strong> This is primarily because unlike younger candidates who have only seen the “next often higher” path, older candidates have made sacrifices and decisions that ended the always upward narrative.

<strong>There are all kinds of reason the path is crooked.</strong> You chose to limit your search to your current town, you stayed at home for a while to raise the kids, you listened to your experience/heart and took an unpopular stand on a controversial issue, you pulled back to care for someone that’s sick in your life, you changed careers, you took a chance, you followed your passion into a role with less title and pay, or maybe you just made a mistake. The reason doesn’t matter, but now your career narrative is flawed; it is no longer always mo’ better on the chart of Prestige.

<strong>An imperfect candidate is often the most perfect next hire.</strong> When companies are screening hundreds if not thousands of candidates, they like tight and predictable narratives. But life is not like that. Courage, resiliency, character, life-lessons, innovation, and often genius are born out of hardship - making a tough call and living with the consequences. Older candidates have life experiences, scuff marks, ups and downs, perspective, and dents. But they’ve lived through it - and are a better hire because of it.

Too often I get the sense the hiring process is more to do with herding than recruiting. I don’t blame anyone, but from this side, especially with larger companies, it feels like the reliance on software and meticulously curated search fields, misses the diamonds hardened by age for the smoother stones of confimists.

My career first act followed the mo’ better chart - up and to the right. Started in technical support, wrote code, got into marketing, did sales, led product marketing and marketing teams, worked at Apple, Intel, startups, ran two business lines from Europe and then reached the first hill top as the inaugural executive director of the Bluetooth trade group. After that ran its course I bounced around a bit then eventually found a calling in nonprofit and helped launch Matt Damon’s Water.org distinguishing our team for its innovation, scrappiness, and success. What an exciting and invigorating second act!

Now I need to write my third and final career act. Even though I have scuff marks and dents I also have perspective and more experience DOING things than most candidates aspire to have over their entire career. Most of the time I have learned from my mistakes and am always ready to share my successes with others. There’s a few more fights left in me so I want to find work with meaning and purpose. I just hope I don’t get overlooked.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What I Learned in 2017</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Happy New Year everyone and welcome to 2018! Below is a short recap of what I learned last year. Lots of life events following my mother-in-law’s death at our home in late December of 2016. My role with a tech reboot here in KC ran its course and I’ve supplemented my semi-retirement job search with consulting which has kept us mostly whole. Our eldest Logan bought his first house. Lucas, our middle son, got accepted to the Peace Corps and left for Rwanda in September. Lina and Jody are doing well so it’s good to have everyone healthy and excited for what this year holds.

<strong>You can give up something cold turkey.</strong> So this really happened in late 2016, but the fact I sustained it through 2017 is pretty amazing. I had a pretty bad Diet Coke habit. It was pretty much all I ever drank. Mornings included a stop at QuikTrip and I guzzled cans throughout the day. It’s funny I don’t remember the exact date, but I just decided to never drink it, and other diet sodas, ever again. I did it cold turkey. When dining out and others get a drink with their meal, I’ll indulge in a real Coke, but never diet. So you can give up something cold turkey if you really want it.

<strong>Getting to bed before 9pm is magical.</strong> One little benefit of my consulting and semi-retirement is I can occasionally get to bed before 9pm. And it’s magical. What’s nuts is you wake up before 6am fully rested. This is something I have never experienced in my post-high school life. Like my mother, I’m pretty nocturnal so staying up past midnight is still pretty common. The problem is my day starts the same time as everyone else. But getting to bed at 9pm means you can wake after eight hours of sleep and still lounge in-between awake and sleep for an hour before getting up at 6am. Wow.

<strong>Money is the only thing that matters in politics.</strong> Some of you know I’m still flirting with running for public office at some point in my life. I believe in public service, and believe most of the folks we have in Washington are not there to serve the electorate but their constituents (donors). Earlier in the spring of 2017 as I was exploring a challenge of Kevin Yoder who represents the Kansas 3rd US Congressional District I was dismayed by what I learned. After meeting with a wide range of operatives, candidates, donors, and insiders it became clear to me that sole measure of your viability as a candidate was solely your fundraising ability. Not your record of public service, the fullness of your heart, your stand on the issues, your willingness to bring change to our country; just how much cash you raise from donors. And we’re surprised our system is so dysfunctional.

<strong>Mantras help keep you focused.</strong> Several years ago I discovered a poem from Diane Ackerman that really moved me. I added to it and every morning of 2017 I recited it to myself. It helped keep me focused and positive in my quest to be a better person, live a healthy life, and leave a positive impact.

In the name of daybreak and the eyelids of morning,
And the wayfaring moon and the night as it departs,
I swear I shall dishonor my heart with hatred or greed,
But instead I shall offer myself up humbly as a guardian of nature,
A healer of misery,
A messenger of wonder,
And an architect of peace.

For the beats and breaths that sustain my life,
For my passions and those yet to be discovered,
For my children, and their children to come,
I swear I will not dishonor my body with idleness and glutenny,
But instead I shall eat to nurious and never simply entertain,
I will exercise and stretch daily,
Drink water relentlessly,
And maintain a healthy weight of 185.

So I don’t always follow through, but I always get a fresh start every 24 hours. No I haven’t lost that much weight yet, but I’m still slowly making progress. Raising an iced Coca-Cola to you, your family, and your vocation on a great 2018!
